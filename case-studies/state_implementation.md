## State Level Energy Initiative: A Power Currency Case Study

### Background
- Population: 6 million
- Current power capacity: 13 GWH
- Available farmland: 2 million acres
- Number of homes: 2 million
- Number of cars: 4 million

### Implementation Strategy
1. Residential Energy Production
   - Goal: 10 KW production capacity per home
   - Total potential: 20 GWH production, 4 GWH storage
2. Vehicle Integration
   - 5% of cars network daily: 4 GWH additional capacity
   - 25% of cars available for emergencies: 20 GWH emergency capacity
3. Currency Design
   - "Bolt": 1 MWH
   - "Zap": 10 KWH
4. Farmland Utilization
   - Allocate 2% of farmland for biofuel production

### Projected Outcomes
- Total energy capacity increase: 33 GWH (250% increase)
- Job creation: [Calculate based on economic impact model]
- Reduction in oil imports: [Estimate based on current consumption]
- Local economic stimulation: [Project based on energy production value]
