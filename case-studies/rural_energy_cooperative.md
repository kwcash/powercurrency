   - Shared investment in wind turbines and solar arrays
2. Land Utilization
   - Use of marginal farmland for energy production
   - Integration of solar panels with existing crop production
3. Power Currency Integration
   - Energy credits distributed based on cooperative membership and production
   - Local businesses incentivized to accept Power Currency
4. Senior Citizen Support
   - Energy credits supplement fixed incomes
   - Home energy efficiency upgrades for cooperative members

### Outcomes
- Increase in local energy production: [Measure total MWH produced]
- Income supplementation for seniors: [Average increase in disposable income]
- New job creation: [Number of jobs in energy production and related services]
