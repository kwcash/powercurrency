	<p class="block_761"><span class="calibre1">Huge increases in energy will lead to great prosperity.  </span>So<span class="calibre1"> what would the impact on GDP be for a doubling of energy output?  Let’s look all the things we can do with this extra capacity. We </span>open up<span class="calibre1"> all kinds of new fields in space and bring hard to believe prosperity.     Some examples:</span></p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_330"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">Agriculture – aquaculture, greenhouses </span></div>

</div>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Many people have made predictions about the future of energy. Google, EPRI and EIA for example see a growth rate of one or two percent per year.  This would bring up to about 1,300 GWH of capacity by 2030, or where China will be in 2014.  We can see a much higher growth rate driven by distributed energy, entrepreneurs, financial incentives, etc... This will lead to a much higher growth in our energy production capability.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_522">EPRI did a study where they predict these changes over 20 or 30 years. The technology exists now and will be brought to market as the entrepreneurs and customers push for it. The market will dictate this, not some agency in Washington DC. </p>

</div>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">This is achievable with no increase in the use of fossil fuels.  The </span>Cap and Trade<span class="calibre1"> people will have a dilemma.  There is an abundance of </span>energy<span class="calibre1"> but it is clean.   Five or ten percent compounded is not hard to achieve.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">If you asked Alexander Graham Bell to look at the current communications technology, he would be amazed.  From a simple telegraph system to now, we have seen the Morse code transformed to streaming video worldwide.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">If you were to ask Henry Ford and Thomas Edison to look at the current state of the electric grid, the car engine, and the money system, they would question why things look so familiar.  The electric grid is a centralized monster using the same technologies as the 1920’s, the internal combustion engine still fires fuel to move a piston, and the money system is still debt based and centrally controlled.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10">Many industries behemoths are now history. Big telecom has had to adapt. The music industry sees record shops go bankrupt and new business models take over. China stores have had to adapt to the demand of the customers and they offer free wireless connections now at McDonalds and Starbucks. AOL ruled the internet, but they would not open their mind to the possibilities, and they stayed with their cash cow dial-up service. </p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">The new energy systems will replace the old giants.   </span>Low cost<span class="calibre1"> battery, low cost solar, and new inventions.  Renewable energy technologies will continue to improve. In the future electric cars, hybrids, solar cells, wind, </span>bio mass and other forms of energy will be made and stored at lower costs. </p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Here are some of the key drivers.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_263"><span class="calibre1">Chips:  The number of </span>micro chips<span class="calibre1"> produced each year is growing exponentially    </span></p>
	<p class="block_263"><span class="calibre1">Communication:  Now there are over one billion people on the internet, and if we add in smart phones, half the planet is connected.  The other trend is the internet of things - pipelines, shipping containers, trucks, and cars </span></p>
	<p class="block_785"><span class="calibre1">Smart:  With all these chips and the communications, it is natural that we will have some sophisticated software to manage the whole system.  The systems are getting intelligent.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_553"><span class="calibre1">Technology advances lead to cheaper and better.  An example is the cost for solar energy.  The cost of production is dropping steadily.  These trends point to a future that has an abundance of energy.  </span></p>
