<h1 id="id_Toc120702759" class="block_4">Ford and Edison</h1>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Henry Ford and Thomas Edison saw the nature of the money problem when the Federal Reserve’s intentions were first exposed.  The media could still report negatively against the nature of the debt money system. Imagine if they could only see our money system now that is built upon thin air.  They give a very logical argument against usury and for the government to issue debt free money to support production.</span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Here is an article from the New York Time December 6, 1921.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_30">FORD SEES WEALTH IN MUSCLE SHOALS</p>
	<p class="block_7">Says Development Will Bring Great Prosperity to That Section of the </p>
	<p class="block_7">South</p>
	<p class="block_30">EDISON BACKS HIM UP</p>
	<p class="block_71">Special to the New York Times</p>
	<p class="block_31">Thomas A. Edison endorsed Mr. Ford’s views…. he is very earnest in his support of Ford’s suggestion by which the Government can complete the property and make its operation possible without cost, by issuing currency against the property instead of interest-bearing bonds….</p>
	<p class="block_30">Support for Ford’s Currency Plan</p>
	<p class="block_31">On the point of Mr. Ford’s suggestion to the Government for financing the completion of the dam, Mr. Edison reiterated his belief that it was a good plan and that if only the currency method is tried in raising money for public improvements, this country will never go back to the borrowing method.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Make it perfectly clear that I’m not advocating any changes in banks and banking,” said Mr. Edison. “Banks are a mighty good thing. They are essential to the commerce of the country. It is the money broker, the money profiteer, the private banker that I oppose. They gain their power through a fictitious and false value given to gold.</p>
	<p class="block_31">“Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar and interest is an invention of Satan,” Mr. Edison continued. “Gold is intrinsically of less utility than most metals. The probable reason why it is retained as the basis of money is that it is easy to control. And it is the control of money that constitutes the money question. It is the control of money that is the root of all evil.”</p>
	<p class="block_31">“Then there is another way—the method my friend Ford proposed the other day. He proposes just to go along and forget about gold. He says that the government can finance Muscle Shoals without applying to money brokers for permission, and I think he is absolutely right about it.</p>
	<p class="block_19"> “But would not Mr. Ford’s suggestion that Muscle Shoals be financed by a currency issue raised some objection?” Mr. Edison was asked.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Certainly. There is a complete set of misleading slogans kept on hand for just such outbreaks of common sense among the people. The people are so ignorant of what they think are the intricacies of the money system that they are easily impressed by big words. There would be new shrieks of ‘fiat money,’ and ‘paper money’ and ‘greenbackism,’ And all the rest of it —the same old cries with which the people have been shouted down from the beginning.</p>
	<p class="block_10"> “Maybe they can’t shout down American thinkers any longer. The only dynamite that works in this country is the dynamite of a sound idea. I think we are getting a sound idea on the money question. The people have an instinct which tells them that something is wrong, and that the wrong somehow centers in money. They have an instinct also, which tells them when a proposal is made in their interests or against them.</p>
	<p class="block_10"> “Now here is Ford proposing to finance muscle Shoals by an issue of currency. Very well, let us suppose for a moment that Congress follows his proposal. The required sum is authorized—say $30 million. The bills are issued directly by the government, as all money ought to be. When the working men are paid off they received these United States bills. When the material is blocked it is paid in these United States bills. Except that perhaps the bills may have the engraving of a water dam, instead of a railroad train and a ship, as some of the Federal Reserve notes have. They will be the same as any other currency put out by the government; that is, they will be money. They will be based on the public wealth already in Muscle Shoals, and their circulation will increase that public wealth, not only the public money but the public wealth—real wealth.</p>
	<p class="block_273">“When these bills have answered the purpose of building and completing Muscle Shoals, they will be retired by the earnings of the power dam. That is, the people of the United States will have all that they put into Muscle Shoals and all that they can take out for centuries—the endless wealth making water power of the great Tennessee River—with no tax and no increase of the national debt.”</p>
	<p class="block_9">But suppose Congress does not see this, what then?” Mr. Edison was asked.</p>
	<p class="block_31">“Well, Congress must fall back on the old way of doing business. It must authorize an issue of bonds. That is, it must go out to the money brokers and borrow enough of our own national currency to complete great national resources, and we then must pay interest of the money brokers for the </p>
	<p class="block_31">“That is to say, under the old way any time we wish to add to the national wealth we are compelled to add to the national debt.</p>
	<p class="block_31">“Now, that is what Henry Ford wants to prevent. He thinks it is stupid, and so do I, but for the loan of $30 million of their own money to people of the United States should be compelled to pay $66 million—that is what it amounts to, with interest. People who will not turn a shovel full of dirt nor contribute a pound of material will collect more money from the United States than will the people who supply the material and do the work. That is the terrible thing about interest. In all our great bond issues the interest is always greater than the principal. All of the great public Works cost more than twice the actual cost, on that account. Under the present system of doing business we simply add 120 to 150 percent to the stated cost.</p>
	<p class="block_31">“But here’s the point: if our nation can issue a dollar bond, it can issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good makes the bill good, also. The difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets the money brokers collect twice the amount of the bond and an additional 20%, whereas the currency pays nobody but those who directly contribute to Muscle Shoals in some useful way. </p>
	<p class="block_31"> “It is absurd to say that our country can issue $30 million in bonds and not $30 million in currency. Both are promises to pay; but one promised fattens the usurer, and the other helps the people. If the currency issued by the government were no good than the bonds issued would be no good either. It is a terrible situation when the government, to increase the national wealth, must go into debt and submit to ruinous interest charges at the hands of men who control the fictitious values of gold.</p>
	<p class="block_31">“Look at it another way. If the government issues bonds, the brokers will sell them. The bonds will be negotiable; they will be considered as giltedged paper. Why? Because the government is behind them, but who is behind the government? The people. Therefore it is the people who constitute the basis of government credit. Why then cannot the people have the benefit of their own gilt-edged credit by receiving non-interest-bearing currency on Muscle Shoals, instead of the bankers and receiving the benefit of the people’s credit in interest-bearing bonds?”</p>
	<p class="block_110"> “The people must pay anyway; why should they be compelled to pay twice, as the bonded system compels them to pay? The people of the United States always accept the government’s currency. If the United States government will adopt this policy of increasing its national wealth without contributing to the interest collector—for the whole national debt is made up of interest charges—then you will see an era of progress and prosperity in this country such as could never have come otherwise.” Let’s apply Edison and Ford’s views in light of<span class="calibre2"> China and the USA.  </span></p>
