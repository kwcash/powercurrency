	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Robert Anderson, a Scottish businessman, made the first auto prototype in the 1830s. It ran on batteries.  By the end of the 1800’s battery powered cars were still outselling gas powered cars and were seen as a toy of the rich. Gas powered cars needed to be cranked to start, and sometimes this was quite dangerous. The electric ignition was a big step to the gas car taking over.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_147"><span class="calibre1">We love to drive our cars. It is part of our culture and reflects our freedom. America has 250 million cars and on average these are driven 12000 miles each year.   The developing world is rapidly building auto fleets.  In 2010, China became the largest </span><span class="calibre1">producer and buyer of automobiles.  Before 2015, there will be more than twice as many cars sold in China each year, than in the USA.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107">In the 1990’s California and General Motors introduced the EV1, an attempt to mass produce electric vehicles. The venture was such a success that California and General Motors collected all the cars and crushed them. </p>

	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">8.1  Highway</span> Miles and GDP</p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">There is a strong relationship between economic growth and using our cars.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">We are looking at the very leading edge of the adoption curve. The technology is here that allows electric cars to equal or outperform gas powered cars and the cost of electricity vs. gasoline will get cheaper.  Plug in hybrids will be like </span>ipods<span class="calibre1"> or mobile phones.  There are thousands of scientists in the USA and millions of scientists in Europe and Asia working to find alternatives to gasoline.  The solution will probably not come from Texas or Detroit, but from Japan, China or some country that is truly at the mercy of OPEC.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Look at other technology areas - flash memory, hard drives, computer chips, you name it.  There will be manufacturing breakthroughs.  We will see higher capacity and longer living batteries in BEV and PHEV vehicles. </span></p>
	<p class="block_506"><span class="calibre2">Not only will electric cars be pollution free, and cost less to operate and maintain, but they will earn income for the owners.  Cars will make money for the car owner when the power is needed and the car is parked (such as mid-afternoon) and then retrieve the power when the grid has slack to give, such as on a windy day. </span></p>

It is theoretical to link ten thousand cars together and expect to get the same output. However, an individual home could use a car for power, especially in a time of emergency such as a hurricane, ice storm, </span>earthquake<span class="calibre1"> or war.  In that situation, a large power plant may be taken </span>off line<span class="calibre1"> or the transmission lines could be brought down.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Until 1994, the US published statistics regarding total horsepower of prime movers.  Included in this were power plants, ship engines, farm equipment mines and automobiles.  Since then, they do not include autos.  Taking recent numbers about power plants and cars on the road and putting an average 200 horsepower per car, we </span>are able to compare the entire electricity industry -nuke, coal, gas, wind, etc. - and compare this to cars. </p>

	<p class="block_90">Here is the total horsepower of the Auto vs. power plants in 2010</p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">In terms of horsepower, large car companies are the largest power plant producers in the planet. The trick is to tie all these together.  If we can tap into this resource, we could increase our energy capacity tenfold.  The inventors that can make this happen will be very rich!    </span></p>
	<p class="block_167"><span class="calibre1">These do not need to come from cars in the driveway.  Instead of crushing engines, we network them into a system, run as needed, capture pollution, and feed the energy into the grid.  We can encase a used car engine and capture exhaust into a filter so there is no noise and air pollution.   We could get 1000 old car engines and put them in an array.  They turn on and off as needed to power the grid during peak periods, blackouts, etc...  We can refit cars with new smaller engines and batteries.  The old engines are pulled out and out to use with other power plants.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Utilities require huge fleets of all kinds of vehicles. A dedicated program to push these into BEV and PHEV will be enough to kick start production. The utilities will expand profits and revenue as people move to electric and PHEV.   It will be an enormous transfer of wealth </span>from Big Oil, to Big Electric and independent producer. Some utilities like PG&amp;E and PJM are converting their own service fleet to plug in hybrid, and<span class="calibre1"> testing out some V2G technology.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_522"><span class="calibre2">There are some other advantages to electric or true hybrid cars in a few years.   Cars can be generators.   The engine is smaller and simpler.   There is flexibility with fuel and power.  You can refuel with various sources of electricity or with </span>bio fuels<span class="calibre2">.   The hybrid approach </span>opens up a lot of space in the car and gets rid of a lot of the shafts that are needed in conventional vehicles. </p>

	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Hybrid cars coming on the road now can handle 25 miles on all electric. In the US, half the people drive less than 25 miles per day.  After the battery runs low, the engine kicks in to drive the car and recharge the batteries. PG&amp;E estimates that though a car battery doesn’t have the power to push a car, it still retains a good deal of life (up to 80%) and useable as storage in fixed locations.   This helps us to trim off the max load, displaces the need to produce new power plants.  </span></p>
