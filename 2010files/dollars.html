Silver was the primary unit of measure and gold was derived from its relation to silver.  Alexander Hamilton measured a basket of dollars and took the average.  As the dollars were worn out a bit, the content was a bit </span>less<span class="calibre2"> so the US dollar was set at 371.25 grains of silver.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_19">Even until 1857 foreign gold and silver coins were allowed as legal money. Anyone could bring in silver, and government put it into a form that all of<span class="calibre1"> the economy could agree upon.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The silver came from the people.  People could take the silver to a mint where it was coined into very exact sizes, weights and mixed with exact amounts of alloys.  Anyone could go out and dig up gold and silver, or conduct trade to attain silver, then bring it to a mint to be coined.  The laws were focused on the weights and measures of the money.  The government was there to provide a service to mint coins and ensure there was a ‘unit of account’.  They </span>opened up<span class="calibre1"> the minting of silver to all people, and to allow foreign coins to be used.  The first mint was established in Philadelphia in 1792 and we now have mints in San Francisco (1854), Denver (1906), and West Point (1973).  It was too troublesome to ship the gold to Philadelphia to mint so the Government also had mints established in Charlotte, North Carolina (1838–1861) and Dahlonega, Georgia (1838–1861) to mint local gold deposits into gold coins.  Andrew Jackson set up a mint in New Orleans, (1838– 1909) to help people in the South and West.  It minted gold and silver in all denominations.  Carson City (1870 - 1893) was set up primarily for silver coins.   There have been private mints especially during gold rushes.  These private mints would coin gold or silver to US specifications and the money was circulated just as if the Government did </span>minted<span class="calibre1"> the coins.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">This unit of account lasted until the Coinage Act of 1965.  This cut the US dollar ‘unit of account’ with silver.  In the 1960’s gold started to break its ‘unit of account’ with the dollar until August 1971 when the dollar cut all ties with any gold or silver.  Go </span>back to Table 1.2 and you see that prior to 1970, the amount<span class="calibre1"> of US dollars was steady, and since 1970 there is a terribly fast rise in the amount of Frollars in circulation.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">2.10 Oil and Gold   Source for data: US Geological Survey, Energy Information Administration</span></p>
	<p class="block_79">There is a simple theory about why there is a fairly constant<span class="calibre1"> ratio among these commodities.  These things take effort to bring out of the ground. They are not so easy to find and are finite.  All these factors give a restriction to commodities that you don’t see with paper money.  In the future we could see a cup of coffee cost $10,000 dollars, but we will not see a cup of coffee cost one ounce of gold.   There is no limit to paper money.   Paper money can be printed and have numbers put on the paper.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_143"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">But, what about making gold and silver money again?  Gold and Silver are excellent forms of money, and they will always be money.  Many States are looking at gold and silver backed money. The problem in the 21</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">st</sup></span><span class="text_3"> Century economy is that gold and silver are used in many electronics products<span class="calibre2"> and we have a problem with hoarding.  Let’s look at this.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_144"> </p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">In 1792, there was not as much opportunity to hoard as developed later with faster sea travel.  In the period of a few days, a whole year’s production of gold can be </span><span class="calibre1">moved anywhere around the globe and put into vaults.  Billions of dollars are spent each year to extract the 2500 to 3000 tons that is mined each year.   If you put all the gold ever mined (160,000 tons) into a football stadium and covered the area within the goalposts and sidelines, the height would be less than three feet.  If you then add the yearly total to this, the amount of gold would be a sheet slightly thicker than half an inch.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The USA has 8,192 tons of gold stored in vaults at Fort Knox, West Point, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  This averages out to about one ounce per person in the USA and it all can fit into a cube about the size of one 900 square foot apartment with a </span>ten foot<span class="calibre1"> ceiling.  It could be put on one ship and carried off in one day.  That is the main weakness of a gold standard.  If we go back to the gold standard for our money, it will be too easy to manipulate and would provoke war in some extreme cases.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">In China there are gold shops popping up all over.  The people buy the gold, but they will not spend the gold.  It is being hoarded.  It is used in gifts and jewelry, but never to transact normal everyday things.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_105">Electricity as ‘Hard’ Money</p>
	<p class="block_19">Now, lets<span class="calibre1"> look at electricity.  Here is the price of electricity in terms of dollars.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_145"><img src="images/image-2.png" alt="Image" class="calibre10"/></p>
	<p class="block_105">2.11 Electricity in cents</p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">You see the trend by now - the big inflation started around the early 1970s and has gone up about four percent each year.   Well, that does not look so good.  How can we use electricity as a standard of value if the value keeps changing? There is no way to predict the future, and the value of our money would drop quickly over time.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">It is the depreciation of the dollar that is the issue here.  In terms of gold, the price of electricity is quite steady.   In fact, electricity in terms of gold or silver gets a little bit cheaper each year, reflecting the technology. Things like computers, mobile phones and such get cheaper – the same is true of electricity priced in relation to gold and silver.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_146"><img src="images/image-3.png" alt="Image" class="calibre11"/></p>
	<p class="block_105">2.12 Electricity and Gold</p>
	<p class="block_147">Here is a look at the prices of common items - electricity, gasoline, Flour, beef, bacon<span class="calibre1"> and apples.

	<p class="block_147"><span class="calibre1">Here are the same items but now priced in terms of electricity.  We simply do a series of ratios to get this.  The price fluctuation over a period of thirty years is quite stable.  Electricity as a standard of value over time is stronger than the paper money we use now.   </span></p>
