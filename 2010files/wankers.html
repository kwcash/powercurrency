<p class="block_9">“Give me the power to issue a nation’s money; then I do not care who makes the law.”</p>
<p class="block_90">Anselm Rothschild.</p>
<p class="block_11">“Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.” President James A. Garfield. </p>
<p class="block_79">Money does not grow on trees – money is made out of<span class="calibre1"> thin air by the Federal Reserve Bank.   </span></p>
<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The Federal Reserve Bank has the most awesome business power - the ability to create money from thin air.   </span>During the course of<span class="calibre1"> the last 100 years, they took over the ability to issue money and control nearly one hundred percent of their money in circulation.  We will look in further detail how they make money from nothing and charge you interest on this. </span></p>
<p class="block_10"><b class="calibre6">The reserve requirement.</b><span class="calibre1">   In 1913, the reserve requirement demanded that forty percent of all money must be backed by gold.  This meant that the banks could create one and a half portions of credit money for each gold dollar it had on hand.  At the end of the First World </span>War<span class="calibre1"> it was at ten percent.  They could create nine dollars of credit money for each gold dollar it had on hand.  So there, they gained the ability to make from thin air, more than seven additional dollars and earn interest on that new money. Now, the ratio of gold to money is about one percent, and there is no requirement that the gold be used for reserves.  Now, they do not need any gold.  Additional money is made based on how much paper money they have in reserves.   </span></p>
<p class="block_242"><span class="calibre1">There was a steady shift in quality of money also.  In 1913, the paper money could be converted to gold and silver.  Through a long process, the money was turned into nothing more than paper slips.  </span></p>
<p class="block_109"></p>
<p class="block_243"><span class="calibre1">Goldfinger:  I prefer to call it an atomic device.  It’s small, but particularly dirty.</span></p>

<p class="block_245">Bond: Well, if you explode it in Fort Knox, the, uh, entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for... fifty-seven years!</p>

<p class="block_106"></p>
<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">The Federal Reserve did not need to use nuclear weapons to destroy the dollar.  The destruction of the dollar was carried out in a systematic, planned manner from 1913 until 1965.  The mortal gunshot wounds to the dollar were on November 22, 1963.  </span></p>
<p class="block_248"><span class="calibre1">Until 1963, paper dollars had some degree of promise.  There were four parts to the notes – 1. issuing bank</span></p>
<ol class="list_">
<li value="2" class="block_249">amount payable</li>
<li class="block_250">a payee (or bearer)</li>
<li class="block_249"><span class="calibre2">a time for payment (or on demand)  </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="block_152"><span class="calibre2">Let’s look at the actual words on the United States Notes.  </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1865-1921, Gold Certificates, secured by gold:</p>
<p class="block_252">This certifies that there have been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America XX Dollars in gold coin repayable to the bearer on demand.</p>
<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">This is pretty good.  You can take your dollar bill and you know that it has gold backing with the US Treasury.  That is a </span>pretty solid<span class="calibre1"> promise.  </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1922-1933, Gold Certificates, secured by gold:</p>
<p class="block_254"><span class="calibre1">This certifies that there have been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America XX Dollars in gold coin repayable to the bearer on demand. This certificate is a legal tender in the amount thereof in payment of all debts and dues public and private.  </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1878-1928, Silver Certificates, secured by silver dollars:</p>
<p class="block_254">This certifies that there have been deposited in the Treasury of the United States XX silver Dollars payable to the bearer on demand ... This certificate is receivable for customs, taxes and all public dues and when so received may be reissued.</p>
<p class="block_251">1929-1962, Silver Certificates, secured by silver coin:</p>
<p class="block_154">This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United </p>
<p class="block_154">States of America XX Dollars in silver payable to the bearer on </p>
<p class="block_255">demand ... This certificate is a legal tender for all debts public and private.</p>
<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">The early versions of the Federal Reserve Notes were also redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the US Treasury.   </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1914-1928, Federal Reserve Notes:</p>
<p class="block_255">The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand XX Dollars ... This note is receivable by all national and member banks and Federal Reserve Banks and for all taxes, customs and other public dues. </p>
<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">Starting in 1929, the FED added the dreaded ‘or other’ or the “or other lawful money” clause.  </span>So<span class="calibre1"> they could give you gold and silver or some other lawful money meaning paper money.  Shall we guess which they would choose to give to you?  </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1929-1933, Federal Reserve Notes:</p>
<p class="block_254">The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand XX Dollars ... Redeemable in gold on demand at the United States Treasury, or in gold or lawful money at any Federal Reserve Bank. </p>
<p class="block_251">1934-1962, Federal Reserve Notes:</p>
<p class="block_255">This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, and is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">JFK planned to issue four billion dollars in new currency that with silver backing.  This represented 20 percent of all money in circulation.  This money would be debt free with no need to pay the bankers any interest. One week after Kennedy’s assassination the first paper notes with no backing came out.   </span></p>
<p class="block_251">1963 -present, Federal Reserve Notes:</p>
<p class="block_154">This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private</p>
<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">The end of real money.  The paper is the money itself, and you must accept it.  It now has no gold or silver backing at all, and no mention of the Treasury or the Federal Reserve Bank.  </span></p>
<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">In 1965 silver backing dropped completely, and in 1968, the old silver certificates were deemed to be only paper, not redeemable in silver. Money now was nothing except for paper.  With no constraints the great inflation and debt bubble could begin.  </span></p>
<p class="block_256"></p>
<p class="block_257"><span class="calibre1">There has always been a struggle for control of money.  The USA got this right in the Constitution and Coinage Act of 1792 when they put a penalty of death on those who debase the money.  Take a look at Table 1.2 </span><span class="calibre1">and  you</span><span class="calibre1"> see that we are living in an environment where all money is debt based Federal Reserve dollars.     </span></p>
<p class="block_31">George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and 99 percent of the other patriots who founded our country knew the evils which come from a debt based<span class="calibre1"> money system.     </span></p>
<p class="block_255"><span class="calibre1">"I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs." </span></p>
<p class="block_258">Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p class="block_255">"History records that The Money Changers used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money, and its issuance." </p>
<p class="block_259">James Madison When the States met to draft a Constitution<span class="calibre1">, they decided to standardize the money.  Congress would decide on how money was made and measured which would help trade among the States.   </span></p>
<p class="block_260">In the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8,</p>
<p class="block_261"> “Congress shall have power to coin money, regulate the value there of” </p>
<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">The Founders knew the evils caused by a fiat currency and looked for a suitable commodity backed money.   They chose silver.  It was more in use among the population and being more widespread it could not be as easily hoarded, like gold.  Silver was considered the people's money; gold was considered the money of the wealthy.   </span></p>
<p class="block_262"><span class="calibre1">Central Banks were tried in 1781, 1791, and 1816.  These all attempted to create money from thin air, and all three banks were killed by Congress. The press of that time attacked the bank and exposed its swindle, the trickery of issuing money from thin air and burdening the taxpayers with debt (</span>similar to<span class="calibre1"> today).  </span></p>
<p class="block_18"><span class="text_3">This continued through the 19</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> Century.  Lincoln avoided monetary disaster by issuing U.S. Dollars, fiat money called ‘Greenbacks’.  Still the bankers persisted until they succeeded in gaining control of the money.  The Federal Reserve Act was signed December 23, </span></span><span class="text_3">1913<span class="calibre2"> giving power to create money to a cartel of private bankers.  The Act authorized the establishment of a Federal Reserve Corporation with a Board of Directors to run it.  The Act states:</span></span></p>
<p class="block_263">An Act To provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes</p>
<p class="block_7">The key phrase there is “and for other purposes”</p>
<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Most people believe the Federal Reserve Banks is a part of government. The FED sure looks like a USA government agency.    The name “Federal Reserve” is a clever term to make you think it is an agency of the United </span></p>
<p class="block_242"><span class="calibre1">States Government.  The banks own 100 percent of the Federal Reserve Bank.  The Federal Reserve Bank is a private corporation. Our own court system has ruled on this issue and made it plain and clear.  Here are two court cases:</span></p>
<p class="block_264"></p>
<p class="block_105">Lewis v. United States, 680 F.2d 1239 (1982)</p>
<p class="block_105">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit</p>
<p class="block_242">Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purpose of the FTCA, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations…..<span class="calibre1">  Each Federal Reserve Bank is a separate corporation owned by commercial banks in its region. </span></p>

<p class="block_265">Kennedy C. Scott, v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, et al., (2005)</p>
<p class="block_265">United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri</p>
<p class="block_7">Filed: April 28, 2005</p>
<p class="block_8">The Bank argues that it is not a federal agency for purposes of Rule 4 because Federal Reserve Banks are distinct from the Board of Governors, owned by commercial banks, and directly supervised in their daily operations by separate boards of directors — not the federal government. Further, the Bank states that Federal Reserve Bank employees are not considered federal employees, officials, or representatives for purposes of 12 U.S.C. § 341. The Bank also contends, inter alia, that the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 451 and relevant case law state that Federal Reserve Banks </p>

<p class="block_30"><span class="calibre2">The ownership of the FED is in proportion to the assets of banks.   </span></p>
<p class="block_263"><span class="calibre1">Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System hold stock in the Reserve Bank in their region, but they do not exercise control over the Reserve Bank or the Federal Reserve System. Holding stock in a regional Reserve Bank does not carry with it the kind of control and financial interest that holding publicly traded stock affords, and the stock may not be sold or traded.  Member banks do, however, receive a fixed 6 percent dividend annually on their stock and elect six of the nine members of the Reserve Bank's board of directors.</span></p>
<p class="block_273"><span class="calibre1">The shareholders of the Federal Reserve Bank are among thousands of banks, but the concentration of power is in a few hands.  Concentration of Assets in the Top four </span><span class="calibre1">Megabanks is over 40 percent.  JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, and Wells Fargo.     Concentration of Assets in the Top ten banks is 50 percent.  Most of these bankers are Wall Street Bankers </span><span class="calibre1">-  Wankers</span>. </p>

<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">In China, it is taboo to talk about Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Taiwan independence and in America, it is taboo to talk about the ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank.  Keep an eye out for </span>this, and<span class="calibre1"> see what happens if this topic ever comes up on air.   This is even truer now that the US debt has reached into the many trillions.  </span></p>
<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">There are about 1500 institutions that tend to own about seventy percent of these companies.  Within the institutional investors, there is a concentration of power.  Here </span><span class="calibre1">is Table 4.4 we see the ownership stakes among very large institutional investors.  These manage hundreds of billions of dollars or even trillions of dollars.   The issue is the concentration of power and the linkage between the Bank Cartel and major media.  These firms collectively own between 23 and 63 percent of these firms.  Also, they own </span>all of<span class="calibre1"> the stocks in question.    If these ten firms decide to do something together – such as the 2008 bailout program – they can do a big power grab financially and in the media.   Of course, the executives through the media will say:</span></p>
<p class="block_154">The public own the funds!</p>
<p class="block_154">The people’s pensions own the funds!</p>
<p class="block_154">Conspiracy Nut! There is nothing here!</p>
<p class="block_154"><span class="calibre2">Look over there!  </span></p>
<p class="block_158">Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Howard Stern!!</p>
<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Who owns these institutions?  If you study this through public sources, you will see that other institutions own each other, banks own the companies that own them, and so forth.  It gets difficult to go much deeper and get names.  We </span>have to<span class="calibre1"> leave it at that and note the concentration of power, the cross ownership, and the control of the media.  </span></p>
<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">In any case, try to find the ownership structure.  If Congress can pass laws to wiretap our internet, they can push for detailed information about who the owners of the owners of the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank.  </span><br class="calibre18" id="calibre_pb_2"/>

	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">4.4 Cross Ownership of Institutions, Bank Cartel, Major Media Initially, the Federal Reserve was controlled by a group of banking interests, and now it is controlled by a group of banking interests.  Perhaps you can find who controls the large institutions.  Maybe the banker bailouts are all a big misunderstanding.  All those stories about aggressive foreclosures, and derivatives that kill towns, are all misunderstandings. The owners of these institutions are really such nice people, so nice in fact that they would like to remain anonymous.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">Ok, then so what?  </span></p>
	<p class="block_316"><span class="calibre1">The Federal Reserve Notes come from the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve Bank.  You can see a simplified balance sheet below.  Assets are things like gold and treasury securities, and the liabilities are the amounts owed to shareholder banks, and the Federal Reserve Notes in circulation. Up to 1950, Federal Reserve notes had gold backing to a large degree. From that point on, gold has dropped steadily.  The chart below shows that the Federal Reserve notes are about equal to the US Securities.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_317"><img src="images/image-8.png" alt="Image" class="calibre20"/></p>
	<p class="block_318">4.5 Federal Reserve Balance Sheet 1950 to 2009</p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">You can see the huge rise in the balance sheet from 1950 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2009.  This reflects the exponential growth of money, and the inflation built into the system.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Notice also that gold declines by half from 1950 to 1970, while the amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation doubled.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">1950 Gold 23 billion; Frollars 26 billion</p>
	<p class="block_7">1960 Gold 18 billion; Frollars 30 billion</p>
	<p class="block_105">1970 Gold 11 billion; Frollars 50 billion</p>
	<p class="block_79">So<span class="calibre1"> whereas, in 1950 there was about as many Fed Notes as there was gold, in 1970, this ratio dropped well over 50 percent.  This is when the Europeans were started to redeem their Federal Reserve Note dollars into </span>gold<span class="calibre1"> and we went off the gold standard.  You can see this was a 20 plus year event, and it was not as if Richard Nixon woke up one day in August 1971 and </span>said ‘let’s not have the dollar linked to gold anymore.’</p>
	<p class="block_107"><b class="calibre6">The Shareholders of the Federal Reserve create money out of thin air, and charge interest on the money that is made out of thin air.</b><span class="calibre1">  This is money that is not backed by gold or silver.  It is backed by other money made from thin air. Note that they are charging interest on public resources and your strengths, but they make the money from </span>thin-air<span class="calibre1"> invented nothing money.  We will see soon that this leads to a transfer of wealth from the private sector over to a small cartel.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Luckily for us, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank published ‘Modern Money Mechanics’ in 1968 giving a detailed description of the whole process.  The document is no longer online, but you can find it through the search engines.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">How this works within the banking system.  </span></p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_319"><span class="calibre1">Bank A creates and lends an amount equal to 90 percent of the reserve requirement.  </span></li>
	<li class="block_320"><span class="calibre1">That money is spent into the economy, into another bank.  Then 90 percent of that is allowed to be lent out.  </span></li>
	<li class="block_321"><span class="calibre1">That money is spent into the economy, into another bank.  Then 90 percent of that is allowed to be lent out.  </span></li>

	<p class="block_323">4.6 Fractional Reserve, Money explosion</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li value="4" class="block_324">And so on….</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Figure 4.6 shows the fractional reserve system with ten percent reserve requirement.  Through multiple steps, the money is expanded ten times. The 1,000 dollars can generate 9,000 in lending which must be paid back with interest.  Now, the bank is not in itself printing out ten times the money, but the banking system working in cooperation among itself, is able to do this.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">If a bank charges for money lent from real assets that is interest earned. They take some risk and provide a service and that interest is good.  For money made from nothing we must use the term ‘usury’.  That money came from </span>nothing<span class="calibre1"> and interest comes from money made from nothing.  We showed earlier how there is a lot of cross ownership among the banks, </span>media<span class="calibre1"> and institutional investors.  Banks can collude to expand money out of thin air.  Let’s suppose that these banks all want to build some wonderful office buildings.  Using fractional reserve banking, they can cooperate to make this happen.</span></p>

	<p class="block_71">4.7 Fractional Reserve Collusion Scenario</p>
	<p class="block_31">All major banks own some shares of other major banks, and we have to<span class="calibre1"> assume they have deposits at the other banks.  Here is a scenario. Customers, pension funds, and businesses put one billion into these banks. Under fractional reserve, these banks can borrow against this money (900 million at first) and place with other banks in the system.  They can take that money and issue out 810 million.  Ultimately, they can send this money around among themselves and come up with ten billion dollars out of thin air.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Theoretically, this can go on forever.  In a </span>worst case<span class="calibre1"> scenario, the Federal Reserve prints money to lend to the government.  This goes to the large banks, who then collude to inflate the money supply.  With this money made from thin air, they can go to buy industry, farmland, smaller </span>banks<span class="calibre1"> and public assets.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Congress can take the power to create currency at any time.  It is an awesome privilege and one which the owners of the Federal Reserve do not like to talk about at all!!  John F Kennedy was the last one to try to do it and he was shot in the head.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Another example.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank buys 100 million USD in US Treasury Bills from a bond dealer with commissions to the dealer.  So where does the FED get the 100 million USD?  From the taxpayer?  No Congress?  No.   Its vault?  No.  It creates the money out of thin air.  The money gets deposited into an account in a commercial bank - most likely one of the big ones mentioned earlier.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">So now we have a net increase of 100 million USD.  That bank has 100 million in its account which are used as reserves for that bank.  It can use this for loans.  The money supply throughout the banking system </span>as a whole increases<span class="calibre1"> 1 billion USD.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107">Using fractional reserve banking, the banks are able to<span class="calibre1"> come up with all sorts of new money.  These are represented in terms like M1, M2, M3, </span>etc<span class="calibre1"> A small percent of the money supply is in actual coin and cash.     </span></p>
	<div class="calibre22">
