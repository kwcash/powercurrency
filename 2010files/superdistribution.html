<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">We have seen companies like Google, Facebook and Groupon explode in popularity.  </span></p>
<p class="block_10">Superdistribution models let customers become redistributors. This ties in very well with the grouping method and recruiting drives that can spur renewable energy. Customers can become group leaders and earn overrides on transactions. They can also develop multi-level models of sales and distribution. The following shows how this might work. </p>
<p class="block_584" id="calibre_pb_6">Superdistribution concept has been around for 20 years. Japanese professor Ryoichi
	Mori at the Institute of Information Sciences and Electronics looked 
	proposed that people could forward electronic content to others so they could try before they buy. 
	Then they would have a mechanism in place to get paid automatically and securely. The interests of all 
	the participants are protected. No firm agreement is needed and the change of money is automatic for 
	all parties. </p>

	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">As applied here, the electric content is the information and financial transactions.  The electricity is sent and delivered through the electric grid or newer smart micro-grids.  The information and transactions are matched with the actual delivery through computer programming and accounting systems.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Let’s dream of a scenario where this can happen with Power Currency. An unleashed distributed power network could see enormous growth in energy.  With an annual growth rate that is very moderate by internet standards, we could see:</span></p>

	<div class="block_332"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">cut pollution 50 to 90 percent from present levels</span></div>
	<div class="block_329"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">cut out all oil imports to a negligible level and start to export energy again. <br class="calibre18" id="calibre_pb_7"/>
