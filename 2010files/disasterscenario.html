<h1 id="id_Toc120702741" class="block_4">Scenario - Disaster</h1>
	<p class="block_167"><span class="calibre1">The big one hit.  8.2 on the Richter scale.  Towers fell, bridges collapsed, it was a nightmare.  Hospitals lost their power, transportation was gone, dams fractured.  The power grid was out.  Blackouts everywhere, which shut off pumps for fuel, fresh water, etc...  Waste treatment facilities shut down. Sewage backed up and disease was brewing.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">The people were prepared.  Thousands of micro grids had been laid - some above ground and some below ground.  Cars could run on local </span>bio-diesel<span class="calibre1">, alcohol, ethanol or traditional gasoline.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_9">Most homes had battery systems to save money on peak energy - buy from the grid at night, and<span class="calibre1"> use during the day.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_71"><span class="calibre2">Towns had their own portable power plants for much of the same reason.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">The biggest thing was the cars<span class="calibre1"> ability to run their engines and feed power to the grid.  They hooked in the converters which fed power to their homes, </span>neighbors<span class="calibre1"> and micro-grids.  The micro-grids were up to 50 locations, and could feed to other micro-grids  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Many of the micro grids still had problems, but enough were functional that hospitals could get power; pumps could operate and most of the worst effects were prevented.  The emergency system kicked in and priorities for power were delivered to make sure that essential services were handled. </span>Of course<span class="calibre1"> the owners and operators are compensated for this and compensated well.  A small fraction of the cars in the affected area hooked </span>in to<span class="calibre1"> the grid and provided more than enough power.  The fuels that had to be stored locally such as alcohol, and </span>bio-diesel<span class="calibre1">, were enough to handle one full week, or up to a month with rationing.  This was plenty of time to allow relief efforts to arrive and start to get things back to normal.  What could have been an aftermath that included disease, deaths, looting, </span>chaos<span class="calibre1"> and anarchy, became a situation that was a lot more organized, orderly, peaceful and less severe.  This all came about because the millions of people had their own power supplies and fuel.  They had this not to prepare for an earthquake, but because it was cheaper to live on and off the grid and to buy and sell in their communities.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_504"><span class="calibre1">FEMA officials came in and tried to round people up and put them into FEMA camps and sports stadiums.  With rare situations, there was no need for that.    </span></p>
