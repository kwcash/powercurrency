	<h1 id="id_Toc120702746" class="block_4">PEER TO PEER ELECTRICITY</h1>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">The networking technology needed for future electricity grids already exists.  There is still some work or inventions needed to make the actual low voltage power lines safe and cheap, but the data and accounting systems are far beyond what we need. Banking ATM networks can deliver cash on demand worldwide.  Phone apps, instant messaging, MSN, Yahoo Messenger, and such can add new functionality.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Online multi-player games can handle millions of people at a time, all interacting with the game engine and other people.  Developing these games and running them requires deep skills in handling complex networks, audits, </span>accounting<span class="calibre1"> and technology.  The online gaming industry requires large data centers full of hundreds or thousands of computers and networks. The younger generation is very open to new forms of currency. All kinds of game currency (weapons, characters, and digital cash) are traded in virtual currency. They make it, trade it, and use it.   Online games like Second Life combine real world money with virtual worlds. People barter among virtual currencies and use real money to buy virtual money. </span></p>
	<p class="block_533"><span class="text_3">In China, thousands of gamers work as ‘gold farmers’, some working more than 12 hour<span class="calibre2"> days pounding away online to earn digital money on games like ‘World of Warcraft’. This virtual money is sold to people around the world.  Tencent is an entertainment portal that targets younger users with online games, instant messaging, and e-commerce services. They use a ‘Q coin’ to allow people to upgrade their online status, buy virtual tools for games, share music, </span></span><span class="text_3">etc<span class="calibre2">…  People buy one Q coin with one RMB (15 US cents). A few years ago, people could buy real world items with Q Coins, and then China’s Central Bank stepped in to put limits and regulations on the virtual currency.  Tencent, also developed a platform called </span></span><span class="text_3">Tenpay, that gives corporate and individuals a means to transact online with real money. The company acts as a clearing platform with a range of value added services. They work with the top banks in China to facilitate the transactions, and earn micropayments on the transactions.</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">x</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">  Tencent</span></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> claims to have more than 200 million people using virtual money.  The government is looking to tax virtual money at a rate of 3 percent on each </span></span><span class="text_3">transaction</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">xi</sup></span><span class="text_3">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">We talked earlier about exponential growth as a way that paper money gets debased and destroyed.   We have all seen the consistent growth in technology in computers, phones, and televisions.   We see this exponential growth can work in systems like Facebook, Google, and Twitter to grow lightning fast.  These jumps can come from </span>a number of areas</p>
	<p class="block_244"><span class="text_5"></span><span class="text_6">Technology<span class="tab">      </span>Marketing</span><span class="text_6"><span class="tab">      </span>Inventions</span><span class="text_6"><span class="tab">      </span>Art</span></p>
	<p class="block_534">Celebrity Endorsements New Selling Systems Distribution Systems Social causes<span class="calibre1"> Willpower.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_273"><span class="calibre1">The power of exponential growth has spurred rapid advances in technology. The adoption of a new currency system is very rapid if people can earn benefits by forming groups.  Remember the MCI friends and family program?</span></p>
	<p class="block_535"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Take a calendar.  If you put one dollar on January 1, then double to two on January 2, four on the 3</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">rd</sup></span><span class="text_3">, eight on the 4</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> and so on.  You will start running into real money in the second and third week. At the end of the month, you will have over one billion dollars.  Facebook grew like this over a period of just a few years.   Power Currency can do the same – especially if it is legal.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_536"><span class="calibre1">Here are some simple scenarios for exponential growth with Power Currency backed by clean energy.  </span></p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_502"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">One person recruits another to join (2)</span></div>
	<div class="block_501"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">One person increases their own capacity every six months </span></div>
	<div class="block_502"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">Two people recruit more</span></div>
	<div class="block_501"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">Social networking sites set up</span></div>

	<div class="block_537"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">these machines will also feed more engines</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Energy production continues to grow. There is a limit, but this limit is not reached for quite a while. And by the time we get there, we will discover more sources of energy in outer space.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">Rapid growth in energy is happening around the world, though at a State<span class="calibre1"> level.  Over the next five years, China will add the same amount of electricity power generation, as the United States has already installed in its entire history up to 2009.  They do this through large coal plants, nuclear reactors, and wind farms.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_32">So<span class="calibre1"> let’s see what it would take to double our installed capacity.  In 2009 we had 1,000 GWH of generating power.  Most of this was produced in central power plants powered by nuke, </span>gas<span class="calibre1"> and coal.  This could be doubled if each home had 10 KW of </span>capacity<span class="calibre1"> or each car had 5 KW of capacity.  This is not difficult to happen with some innovation.  In 1980, only a few people (Bill Gates was one of them) thought that every home could have a computer.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Once solar gets cheap, batteries get cheap or there is a breakthrough with cars, then this will happen.  We will not need to build anymore large nuke or solar plants.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">A large retailer like Sears, Walmart or Home Depot can drive the business. Any US State could implement programs that would make a tipping point. States that push forward early would be the rich states.  They get the jobs, </span>royalties<span class="calibre1"> and the accrued wealth.  It would show other states, and then off we go. </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">If there are technical or social breakthroughs in solar and wind energy, they will crowd oil, gas<span class="calibre1"> and coal out of the mix.  Digital cameras used to be very expensive.  Once a tipping point hit, then they took 99 percent of the market from cameras that require film and processing.  We will see the same when there is a breakthrough in solar energy.  Fuel for solar and wind is free.    Digital photos are free; film photos cost money to buy and process.  Solar fuel is free; oil and gas cost money to get, distribute and use.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">With the power of such high growth, the biggest deterrent is government involvement and special interests. The best thing the Government can do is to allow the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish.   The </span>second best<span class="calibre1"> thing governments can do is to provide incentives and tax breaks. Even tax the bad fuel to spur on the good.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_19">Decentralized energy let’s us take a new look at this energy situation. Let’s start at the grass roots and work your way up to the national level, going from individuals, through groups, neighborhoods, companies, towns, on up to national level. </p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">There is a case to be said for grassroots level power generation. The power of a small number compounded many times, is very strong.  Any person, company, </span>city<span class="calibre1"> or state can take the lead. Once the first one is successful, then others will follow.  The early adopters will get a </span>small short<span class="calibre1"> term financial return on their own investment but an additional emotional return on investment.  They will get a jump on what will become a great new market.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">In the future we will see millions of cars with energy, along with millions of small energy units at fixed locations.  This offers a great opportunity for them to trade directly with each other.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a collaboration model that ties together computing resources to link straight with each other over a network.  Most people associate P2P with file sharing and the negative connotations of illegal downloading of movies. Once Peer to Peer Electricity takes off, then the economic benefits will wipe out resistance.  If the US Federal Government kills this, then it will take hold in other countries, and come back to America ten or twenty years later.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Some additional benefits that will help drive networking and group development.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><b class="calibre6">Added land value. </b>We have an abundance of land to produce electricity and bio fuels<span class="calibre1">. Much of the land useless for farming or grazing is suitable for solar or wind energy.  The land is available for less than 1000 USD per acre. Putting energy on this land will increase the income ability of the land and drive up the land values, not to mention the </span>land owner’s<span class="calibre1"> balance sheet.   Farms use land for biofuel plants, processing, etc... </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><b class="calibre6">Avoided capacity Costs and New financing opportunities</b><span class="calibre1">.  Many states have a standard contract for small power producers when they negotiate with the big utilities.  A group of 500 New Yorkers could pool resources and set up a 500 MW wind farm. They get paid in </span>kwcash and sell excess to others. Some will donate to charity; some will sell, etc…</p>
	<p class="block_80"><b class="calibre6">Many small beat few large</b><span class="calibre1">.   Large power plants can take many years to build - nuclear power plants over ten years, large coal plants perhaps five years. </span>Small distributed<span class="calibre1"> energy systems can be built and working in weeks, days or even hours.   Some successful entrepreneurs will become gigawattaires.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Any one of the following sectors could do enough to push this over the edge.  Any one of these can make the difference.  They can use the revenue models we will cover in the next chapter.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><b class="calibre6">Corporations </b><span class="calibre1">use scale to set up large systems.  Employees, and even customers or suppliers can buy into the plants and share in the output. Companies like Google, Apple, Home Depot, and Walmart can make the whole thing happen.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><b class="calibre6">Associations </b><span class="calibre1">have a great opportunity to drive new energy.  They can pool their member’s resources and build large scale systems.  Then the members will enjoy the resulting credits which they can use, trade, purchase, and sell.  One association like the National Automobile Dealer Association can make a huge difference.  The NADA would provide the framework for their </span>20000 member<span class="calibre1"> car dealers to join.  Then these dealers pass membership benefits onto their customers.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_538"><b class="calibre6">Universities </b><span class="calibre1">are an excellent source of early adopters.    They can subsidize these activities.  They can build new vehicles, new energy and so on.  They also sit on a lot of land and can install the energy devices. Vehicles on campus tend to travel locally and easily move to all electric or PHEV.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_538"><b class="calibre6">Research Institutions,</b><span class="calibre1"> like universities, are sitting on large amounts of land and have the resources to build things for the long term without requiring immediate ROI.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_538"><b class="calibre6">Industry Groups.</b><span class="calibre1">  Companies within certain industry groups will come together and collaborate on these solutions.  For </span>example<span class="calibre1"> the high tech industry could push for their supply chains and customers to get onto renewable energy.  Software and hardware companies will form together and do this.  IT companies could establish pricing models where they are paid in energy.  IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, all could earn huge profits in terms of Power Currency.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_538"><b class="calibre6"><span class="calibre1">Financial Institutions.  </span></b><span class="calibre1">Banks that have bad loans can use this to fix their balance sheets.  They cannot sell the bad </span>asset<span class="calibre1"> but they put some renewable energy sources on distressed properties and sell the energy.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_538"><b class="calibre6">Utilities</b><span class="calibre1"> are an obvious candidate for early adopter as they have the infrastructure in place.  Many states are mandating that the utilities will have a certain percent renewable by a certain date.  They have the customer base.</span></p>
	<p class="block_147"><b class="calibre6">Eco-Activists</b><span class="calibre1"> are important.  They pay a higher price to be on the leading edge.  People who buy the new Tesla pay three times the price of a normal car.       </span></p>
	<p class="block_539"><b class="calibre6">Manufacturers</b><span class="calibre1"> have some good assets that be reenergized.  Many also have power plants that can work on weekends.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><b class="calibre6">Stock Exchanges</b><span class="calibre1"> have the trading platform in place to bring this to market.  They can pull in members to buy into the renewable energy.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_539"><b class="calibre6">States.</b><span class="calibre1">  States have the resources, land, and people.  A state could wipe out its own debt and add funds to pensions with energy.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><b class="calibre6">Military.</b><span class="calibre1">  The logistics requirements of fuel are difficult in remote locations.  Vehicles on the battlefield will provide the power for new laser weapon systems.       </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Now, within anyone of these sectors, or from the ground up, let’s go into how these can tie together and communicate.  Let’s look at this from simple to complex.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_540"><span class="calibre1">    Most basic level.  At this level, it is just the customer and another customer, or the utility.  The customer may have an electric vehicle, own power supply, or live entirely off the grid.  They may deploy some batteries to buy cheap energy at night and go off grid during the peak expensive periods.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_541"><img src="images/image-8.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre41"/></p>
	<h1 id="id_Tocp2ptwo" class="block_4">P2P two homes</h1>
	<p class="block_542">At the most basic level two nodes representing end users can communicate and conduct a transaction. They would exchange at least two messages related to negotiation of an energy supply from one to the other. With this transaction, energy can flow from one to the other. The messages will be in a standard format such as EDI, XML or some future language.</p>
	<p class="block_368"><span class="calibre1">    Local level.  In a group of homes on a street, or small neighborhood, the participants will buy and sell from each other.  When there is a shortage, some local resources can kick in, such as a car or generator.  The transactions stay local.  It can tap into the small energy sources at customer’s homes and vehicles.    The local transformer will </span>distributed<span class="calibre1"> power within its network, and the transactions are accounted locally.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_543">This will open up new capacity for electric automobiles to recharge while absorbing potential strain on the power grid. Electric energy companies will achieve better efficiencies. They will save investment costs on existing poles, wires, stations<span class="calibre1"> and plants. They will have more new sources of high profit revenue as they broker energy transactions. This will help to relieve power grid bottlenecks and constraints.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_544"><img src="images/image-9.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre41"/></p>
	<h1 id="id_Tocp2pstreet" class="block_4">P2P street</h1>
	<p class="block_545"><span class="calibre1">Town level.  This has robust protection, communications, networking, and safety systems.  Here is where communities start to develop sophisticated solutions.  We start to see virtual power plants.  If you take a large number of small systems and make them appear and act as one larger power </span>plant then you have a virtual power plant. In this environment, all the pieces are virtualized and combined to look like one larger resource. </p>
	<p class="block_546">Each virtual environment is managed and developed from scratch. There are many environments, from a small two node system,<span class="calibre1"> to something that takes place nationwide. It can be industry groups, affiliations, sports teams’ promotions, coffee shops, chain stores, and peer to peer networks, anything...  </span></p>
	<p class="block_547"><span class="calibre1">     County, State Level.  Here we see larger networks and Virtual Power Plants.   Whole robust communities will evolve.  Each location can have a number of </span>power<span class="calibre1"> generating devices, and each of those have a unique identification.  For example, a small business has a solar array, wind turbine, battery packs and some vehicles with batteries. There can also be many nodes in remote areas such as a wind farm or solar concentrator. Then as two or more join they can have one time or </span>long term<span class="calibre1"> relationships and transactions.  Once the other sources are identified then the users swap or transact energy.</span></p>
	<p class="block_548"><img src="images/image-10.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre42"/></p>
	<p id="id_Tocp2plocal" class="block_549">P2P neighborhood</p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">People within a P2P network create connections with others forming a group of two or more.   Applications are endless. Group systems set up where people opt into a virtual network of energy users and savers that use a series of business rules to swap or trade energy back and forth. </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">We have seen Peer-to-peer networks expand very quickly.  Technology will drive breakthroughs that make local power generation cheaper and more convenient.   What is new is the emerging trend for individuals to become power producers and owners of the means to produce, then to share these resources with others. The benefits reach across many owners and make the overall system much more valuable.  A network of ten users will make a virtual power plant that gives back twenty times the benefit.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_550"><span class="calibre1">Peer to peer is not new.  There were earlier sorts of applications that used this type of system. SABRE travel reservations started in the 1960’s and used a lot of P2P concepts.  Car dealers have had peer to peer commerce systems for decades.  They </span>are able to<span class="calibre1"> locate parts and order directly from other car dealers.  Car Dealer A could send out a parts request to a local network of dealers and quickly get an answer of availability, </span>price and delivery time. This was first put into work in the 80’s and was standard practice for car dealers in the USA in the 1990’s. The communications to <span class="calibre1">make this happen went through a central hub, and though expensive by today’s standards, it worked very well and was big business.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_551"><img src="images/image-11.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre43"/> </p>
	<p id="id_Tocp2parea" class="block_552">P2P Town and Up</p>
	<p class="block_11">Without this, the parts departments would rely on phone calls and higher inventory amounts. The vendor provided a valuable service to make this work and was rewarded very well. </p>
	<p class="block_273"><span class="calibre1">The direct buying and selling of power will also free up space on the traditional large transmission lines, as buyers and sellers can deliver over local power networks.  A lot of these networks will need to be set up from scratch, but that is part of the whole economic growth model.</span></p>
	<p class="block_219">Energy distribution will be more dispersed and rely less on large power plants at the ends of the energy supply chain. The slack in the end of the power grid can absorb enormous additional capacity that could not occur in a top down<span class="calibre1"> centralized approach as we now have.  This will be especially useful in blackouts, ice storms, and disaster situations.  A distributed grid resists a military attack against the power grid. It would be much harder to take down the entire grid if the bottlenecks have multiple workarounds and backups. It can help to isolate problems and thus provide fault containment that would not be possible otherwise. </span></p>
	<p class="block_553">There will be many applications that tie into other forms of entertainment and parts of our lives. Think what sports can do to leverage their brands into fabulous multiplayer games. Also, with new technology like 3D TV, holograms home entertainment complexes, the electricity required will be huge. This grows the use of electricity, builds wealth and creates jobs. </p>
