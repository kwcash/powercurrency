<h1 id="id_Toc120702751" class="block_4">KW CASH</h1>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">A major franchise retail store decides to promote clean energy as part of its corporate social responsibility.  They offer clean KWH credits to their customers.</span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">These credits are used as cash.  The customers use this as gifts or make purchases at other locations.  The store opens a membership club.  A percentage of sales from customers go into a membership pool for renewable energy.  The store keeps </span>half<span class="calibre1"> and the customers get credit for their proportion.  The more they purchase, the more they get credits. This nationwide retail store sets up a remote site for low cost concentrated solar power of more than 100 MW installed capacity and some wind energy shares.    Each store installs PV cells, small </span>wind<span class="calibre1"> and battery banks. Excess power is sold to customers who have PHEV and come to the store to shop.  They are given free KWH if they buy more than 50 dollars in any one trip.  If the stores, cannot fulfill their energy requirements then they buy from the grid at prevailing rates.  At nighttime they load up on cheap base load </span>energy, and<span class="calibre1"> use that during the day.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_554"><span class="calibre1">Power Currency is designed to work within the existing financial and energy systems.  There are unlimited revenue and pricing models.  Secure, trusted tools manage the relationships between consumers, suppliers, and service providers.   All kinds of plans can be put together.  Transactions tie in with the energy management systems.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_554"><span class="calibre1">A wide range of service providers participate.   Agents and third parties produce, </span>distribute and provide information or transaction services. These provide customers with access to range of suppliers and producers from multiple sources. They use some means to identify and group customers according to class, location, etc... An agent’s business model will let it add a premium as they are bringing economies of scale and provided services to the marketplace. They add efficiencies, guarantees, financing, and pull together groups to bring in discounts. </p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Service providers will be a very important part of the growth of this process.  Service providers provide excellent services in the paper money system we have </span>now, and<span class="calibre1"> can use many of the same tools and talents to build the Power Currency economy.  They open many new business models, push viral </span>marketing<span class="calibre1"> and build the exponential growth.  In addition to the financial aspects, there are all kinds of data applications here. These are tied in with marketing, vehicle use, media, telecom, and endless other applications.  Marketing related information tied to demographic, income, and other factors are used.   These can add new levels of opportunities for incentives, and discounts.   These also bring about schemes for bundling. For example, an air conditioner is sold with a set </span>amount<span class="calibre1"> of kilowatts that are financed.   Groups of individuals can come together in a </span>peer to peer<span class="calibre1"> method to form a buying group.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_80">There are great opportunities for software companies, consulting companies and any sort of service provider. They not only will figure out great ways to bring these to the market but they will be able to have an extra layer that gets transaction revenue. This will provide long term steady income </p>
	<p class="block_105">Let’s look at a few business models from least to greater complexity. </p>
	<p class="block_79">The first scenario is a simple one – a direct transaction where a customer has a direct link to the source of energy. They will use a clearinghouse to manage the transaction. The clearinghouse is tied in with the utility. </p>
