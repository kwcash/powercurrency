<h1 id="id_Toc120702756" class="block_4">STATE AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS</h1>
	<p class="block_147">"The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government's greatest creative opportunity." </p>
	<p class="block_586">Abraham Lincoln </p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">We are seeing stress within the states – asset sales, loss of jobs, cuts in services, destruction of pensions, and misery.  Most States have budget deficits and then feel compelled to sell real assets to pay off credit money debt that was created out of thin air.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">During the Great Depression, thousands of cities issued local scrip.   Now many states like California face a terrible budget deficit.  One proposal is to issue IOUs to their State workers.  The IOUs or scrip are not forced on </span>vendors<span class="calibre1"> but they are used as money for any State tax or service.  This is enough to provide a market for the scrip.  The IOUs are redeemable at some time in the future though with some added interest attached.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_167">So<span class="calibre1"> a vendor could receive these IOUs instead of Federal Reserve Notes and use the IOU for state college tuition or taxes.  Because the State accepted the warrants, the IOUs have value and are accepted among the citizens.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_30">The Constitution states.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Article I, Section. 10. No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or </p>
	<p class="block_31">Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.</p>
	<p class="block_31">Paper IOUs are workable for emergencies, but<span class="calibre1"> go against the restrictions in the Constitution.  Power Currency provides a stronger solution and keeps the politicians from printing too many paper IOUs.  Setting up a system to issue money, the State will never have a deficit (unless they want), can wipe out unnecessary interest </span><span class="calibre1">payments and expand its economy.  One way to issue legal money is with coins that mix in a small portion of a grain of silver or gold.  The coins can be in KWH or MWH denominations.  The coins would not have enough gold or silver to attract financial elements that will gather them up and take them out of circulation.  It would be closer to the spirit of the Constitution than Federal Reserve Notes.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">A local based currency backed by energy with a national currency for trade will work well together.  Currency that is restricted geographically tied in with the local electricity grid will be even stronger.  If a State is producing 50 gigawatts of electricity per day, then they could issue 5 gigawatts worth of coins for circulation.  In theory, the person could submit coins for payment of their energy bill or pay taxes, and the State can use the coins to pay energy bills.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Many British Commonwealth countries have two or more currencies.  The Isle of Guernsey in the British Channel issued a limited amount of money into circulation and was able to build infrastructure, </span>buildings<span class="calibre1"> and other projects.  These Guernsey pounds are spent into existence for public </span>works, and<span class="calibre1"> are taken out of circulation to pay for fees and taxes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">During the currency crisis in Argentina in 2000, some provinces issued their own money which returned as taxes.  The population accepted this. This was short lived but helped through some rough months.  The national government swapped them out with pesos in 2003.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_30"><span class="calibre2">So having a parallel currency could work.  Here are some steps.  </span></p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_587"><span class="calibre1">Issue interest bearing IOUs to State workers, contractors and to people who receive tax refunds.  These are used in the future for payment of taxes and have a redemption date before which they cannot be cashed.  Something like issued: 2011, redeemable: 2014 – 2015.  </span></li>
	<li class="block_587"><span class="calibre1">Assert this as real local money.  As this is accepted within the community, more people will use the money.  Local retailers, restaurants, and merchants will accept the </span>money<span class="calibre1"> so it becomes widespread.  </span></li>
	<li class="block_587"><span class="calibre1">Eventually, you will have two (or more) currencies - regional money, national/international money.  </span></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Local money works best as it fosters cooperation among the community. The money stays local.   Federal Reserve Notes are </span>debt based<span class="calibre1"> money that drains from the local community out to large money centers and foreign countries.  All money is issued as debt.  Since the debt needs to be paid back, there is a limit to growth, and there is a shift from the productive forces in society to the money changers.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Each state will have its own priority and solution</p>
	<p class="block_588">Hawaii – Displace oil, waves</p>
	<p class="block_588">KY – Coal, biomass</p>
	<p class="block_588">Arizona – Solar</p>
	<p class="block_589"><span class="calibre1">PA – natural gas, offshore wind with DE An approach is to consider Public Trusts and Public Credit.  State resources such as minerals, land, </span>ports<span class="calibre1"> and such are used to back local money.  The backing is handled through a State Bank.  States should never sell off such </span>assets, but<span class="calibre1"> can use them for the common good and as the foundation for local money.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Public Infrastructure and public works projects work well.  Some of the public </span>works<span class="calibre1"> programs in the 1930s were very effective.  The Hoover Dam, Tennessee Valley Authority and thousands of other projects put people to work and spent money into the economy.   Get debt free money into the economy through business loans to build public sector projects, agricultural support, </span>salaries<span class="calibre1"> and welfare payments.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">You can build large networks of renewable energy systems.  This is strong in an economy that has a lot of productive talent.   Convert old factories to new factories.  As this is distributed around the community, it will be enough to stimulate the new economy.  Without the usury that explodes the debt, a local money system can grow much faster than the usury Federal Reserve System.  Without usury overhanging all production, the prices of items will be cut in half and quite competitive with ‘Made </span><span class="calibre1">in China’.  In fact, production in China is financed at zero percent and in a lot of cases is subsidized at about fifteen percent.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_110">By now, you know that I like to use tables and graphs to make a point. Lets look at the asssets<span class="calibre2"> of States.   First, the United States.  </span></p>

With inflation and technology advances, we will see the value of the energy more than the loan payment. This will be a sound investment for anyone.    In this way, the money supply is brought back in line and replaced with producing assets.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Using this same model, we can finance production and sales of electric vehicles, mass transit and other projects.   If there is a Constitutional question about the nature of the money, then just keep it purely as an investment vehicle.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">The State Bank could set up a mechanism to guarantee the energy payments, and to extinguish the loan amounts as the payments in energy come into the system.  The State can convert the debts into energy units and clear out the credit money.   Eventually, this converts the money from debt based to non-</span>debt based<span class="calibre1"> money.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">11.5  Free</span> Market Economy with Power Currency</p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">With this process, the money production function gets spread out to the population at large.  This is the best method of all and is </span>similar to<span class="calibre1"> the method set up by George Washington and Congress in 1792.  Back then, the people would bring silver and gold to the mint to be coined.  How they found the </span>metals, or<span class="calibre1"> earned them was up to the individual.  The government was there to simply mint the coins and make sure that all coins were </span>exactly the same<span class="calibre1"> weight and composition as the others.  </span>So the process looks like this:</p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Now, instead of bringing gold or silver to the mint, people bring energy production to the utility.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Each State has its own resources – solar, biomass, wind, hydro.  A State like Pennsylvania that is opening new natural gas fields can use this as collateral to finance thousands of small solar, wind, and electric vehicles.  States with distressed real estate can use some form of this to support refinancing with low interest loans tacked on with their mortgages.  The guarantee is to cover existing electricity and some gas.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_670"><span class="calibre2">  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1"> With this system, States can fill the budget gap with state issued scrip backed by energy.  This comes from gas and future increase in electricity production via wind and coal.   Communities can use this mechanism to attract companies.  They issue a </span>guarantee<span class="calibre1"> production deal that will ensure a steady production and sale of solar PV, solar thermal and wind generating equipment over 10 years, with more to follow.  With </span><span class="calibre1">a  goal</span> to ‘go green’ at two percent per year and then to add more after that they are able to guarantee 10,000 new jobs, land grants or concessions for manufacturers, etc<span class="calibre1">…  Then they add incentives that buildings need to install building integrated solar systems, rooftop systems and wind and CHP.  Some of the new manufacturing will get financed by pension money, and payback is guaranteed at a fixed rate.  The companies will be able to earn the profits above that level assuming they reinvest a certain amount per year into further development.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Other scenarios like this can be used with state pension plans.  The pension fund allows workers to invest in renewable energy and receive their pension payment part in USD and part in KWH.  People invest between one percent and 25 percent of their </span>pension money into this plan as the money is allowed to grow over time by the time<span class="calibre1"> they hit retirements they are looking at more than enough energy for their own needs.  They sell off excess to their neighbors or allow it to accrue in their account.  They can buy coffee, food, clothes and whatever they want with the extra energy backed money.  State pension funds can match contributions from the loan interest we mentioned above.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">Some States are setting targets for new energy production across the board. Pennsylvania’s “25 by 25” sets a goal for the year 2025 - 25 percent of electricity sales by renewable energy and 25 percent share of motor fuel are by renewable resources.  But why do states insist on asking money from the Feds. They can move forward. With a </span>State currency, internal, backed by State assets, they can make things happen. We could have the following</p>
	<p class="block_671">2020. 50 percent increase in the installed capacity of electricity. 25 percent of new car sales will be plug-in hybrids and a further 20 percent of all used cars will have been converted to hybrid or plug-in hybrid.</p>
	<p class="block_672"><span class="text_5"></span><span class="text_6">2025.<span class="tab">      </span>100 percent increase in installed capacity. Zero oil imports. </span></p>
	<p class="block_673"><span class="calibre1">2030.    200 percent increase in installed capacity. 90 percent of new car sales are plug-in hybrid with most of the rest using some sort of renewable liquid fuel. No imported oil. </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">State taxes can be paid with locally produced energy.  All the production and payment </span>is<span class="calibre1"> within the state, so it will not interfere with the Commerce clause.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">A State like Michigan has many skilled people who are unemployed.  The State can set up a fund that supports manufacturing and power generation. Or they provide land for this purpose and subsidize the output. Then they encourage businesses to purchase part of their energy from this system. This will add to the economy as the seller of electricity is earning income which they will reinvest.  They can set up system where the company will earn tax breaks if they reinvest profits back into the renewable energy field and hire local citizens.   Adopting a power currency system can help both employers and the employees to negotiate better labor </span>contracts, and<span class="calibre1"> find a win-win for everyone.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Cities and counties can tie in new development efforts with property taxes. People have an option to buy into a town sponsored wind farm coop.  The buy in allows people to make a small capital investment into the farm then get paid back in KWH cash.  Through revitalization campaigns, residents </span>are able to put energy systems in their homes that are produced locally. The town is able to<span class="calibre1"> finance the placement of 5,000 units installed over a period of time.  Then some vacant lots and deteriorating warehouses and homes are turned over to small bio-fuel refineries and power plants. This then burns off some of the waste from the residents feeding this heat and electricity back into the local grid.  This could easily handle 20 percent of the energy needs of the town.  Furthermore, the investors </span>are able to<span class="calibre1"> see a return on their investment in the form of cash, energy credits and the increased value of the land.  The local government also wins with higher tax collections.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Universities can set up funding mechanisms.  Parents buy into the energy with the savings plans.  Then they pay tuition in the future with amounts on order of 10 MW per year, fixed.  The invested amount goes into wind farms, and micro grids.  Students earn credits for doing things for the community, care for the elderly, </span>etc<span class="calibre1">…   The schools can set aside a quota of 5 percent or so to cash in these currency units.  Online education communities can use Power Currency to facilitate barter.  The professors can accept money in LETS hours, Federal Reserve debt money, or Power Currency.  The students can pay likewise.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Scenario – Year 2030.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">As coal fired plants age, they are shut down.    The downtown area has one million square feet of commercial office space and power systems they use an array of distributed resources.  The area buildings fill up on energy during early morning hours and place this potential into banks of flywheels, </span>batteries<span class="calibre1"> and other storage.  Vehicles in the parking lot can plug in and help with peak load, base </span>load<span class="calibre1"> or even sell their KWH to neighboring buildings.  The hybrid cars can turn on engines and feed power right into the local grid and work as an </span>emergency generators<span class="calibre1"> in times of blackout, or unusual peak demand.  As an added benefit, this system also will provide a significant benefit to the </span>City<span class="calibre1"> distribution grid by reducing load on the grid during the critical summer peak hours.  It plans to tie in the parking garage so that BEV and PHEV can offload KWH of energy during peak times.  This energy will be paid back to the customer in credits.  The office town pulled in their parking garage to installs a system </span><span class="calibre1">for pulling KWH from the cars and selling to the local buildings.  The garage has 1000 slots, 400 of which </span>are able to<span class="calibre1"> pull in KWH.  In exchange for 10KWH, they reduce the price of parking by half. This provides 4 MWH per cay - 400 x 10 KWH - during peak times.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">The town has developed more than enough energy for its own needs.  They have three GWH generating capacity.  From this they use one GWH; they export and sell one GWH capacity, which brings in millions of dollars to its tax </span>base, and<span class="calibre1"> use the other GWH as incentives.  The residents who bought into the coop get dividends and rebates from this as well as eliminating their power bill.  Due to recent economic changes, the town decided to attract companies with high wage jobs with very attractive rates to the company on power, </span>subsidies<span class="calibre1"> and land use.  The city issues bonds backed and guaranteed by the MWH sales contracts that it has developed with buyers.  These bonds are used for infrastructure, arts, and general welfare.</span><br class="calibre18" id="calibre_pb_9"/>
