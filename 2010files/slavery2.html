	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">As a military general would look at a map and find the situation and plot strategy, collectivists look at the Flow of Funds to find opportunities to shift huge portions of the economy from one side to the other.   The Federal Reserve Bank published the flow of funds report each quarter. This report gives a snapshot of the condition of the national economy.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_79">This is a steady progression of more and more debt, slowly and over time. There is no<span class="calibre1"> up and down short term trend.  The trend is constant and in one direction.  This reflects the mathematical nature of the debt, and the 100 percent control over the money that the Federal Reserve enjoys.   The net effect is just a few percent per year, but the </span>long term<span class="calibre1"> results are horror. Assets are stripped away from the USA economy and moved over into the financial sector and offshore accounts controlled by hedge funds, private equity, old money, foreign dictators, and other such types.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Here is a breakdown of the Net Assets positions of the various sectors in the flow of funds from 1952 to 2010.  Anything below the line is in debt, and above the line positive assets.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_403"><img src="images/image-9.png" alt="Image" class="calibre28"/></p>

	<p class="block_28"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">The scale on the left is the amount compared to the GDP.  The two lines at the top show the growth in the financial sector and shows the assets taken by foreigners in relation to the USA GDP.  The line at the bottom shows the increasing debt load of the total US economy.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Domestic nonfinancial sectors credit market consists of five parts:</p>
	<p class="block_404">Federal Government</p>
	<p class="block_404">State and Local Government</p>
	<p class="block_404">Households – that’s all of us</p>
	<p class="block_404">Nonfarm nonfinancial corporate – Walmart, Ford, small stores, etc</p>
	<p class="block_404">Nonfarm noncorporate – churches, schools, etc</p>
	<p class="block_79">Until the mid 1980<span class="calibre1">’s we were carrying a total debt about equal to our GDP, though there was a steady trend downward.  Since that time, and especially since 2001, the rise in debt has been quickening.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Based on Figure 6.1, here are three projections for our debt to GDP levels in the future.  The </span>best case<span class="calibre1"> scenario has it reaching 280 percent of GDP. This cannot be avoided through raising taxes.  It is a mathematical certainty because </span>all of<span class="calibre1"> our money is issued as debt and that debt needs to be paid back to the banking cartel.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_405"><img src="images/image-10.png" alt="Image" class="calibre29"/></p>
	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">6.2  GDP</span>/Debt projections</p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">If we take the growth rate from the past ten years, the debt to GDP will be over ONE THOUSAND percent by 2050.  At that point, the country is completely different.  It will be debt slavery for 99 percent of the people serving one percent at the top.  This brings us back to Medieval Europe. </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Those one percent usurers certainly want this to happen.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">The banking cartel makes hundreds of billions in profit through legal manipulation and loaning money that is made from thin air.  This collection of interest from money backed by nothing is usury.     Usury has a long history dating back thousands of years.  The usury system is the most profitable system ever invented – if you are the debt collector.  It is a massive drain on the economy and a transfer of wealth from the production part of the economy over to the bank cartel.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">From time to time, some of them will have a conscience or will boast.  Sir Josiah Stamp, president of the Bank of England and the second richest man in Britain in the 1920s declared in an address at the University of Texas in 1927:</span></p>
	<p class="block_406"><span class="text_3">“The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in inequity and born in sin . . . . Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them but leave them the power to create money, and, with a flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again. . . . Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. . . . But, if you want to continue to be the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit.”</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">viii</sup></span></p>
	<p class="block_8">A company like Ford Motor Company made 2.7 billion profit<span class="calibre1"> in 2009.  To do this they had to employ 159,000 people.  They had to engineer, design, promote, market, build, and do all the functions.  They </span>have to<span class="calibre1"> have hundreds of factories, finance the land, build, and maintain the buildings and equipment.  For large financial institutions, hundreds of billions can be taken through legalizing usury systems and private issuance of money.  There are various collectivists systems to study – China’s Cultural Revolution, Nazi Germany, Stalin’s purges.  The tricky ones are the slow to develop.  The termites destroy homes just as effectively as fire, but they take a long time.  Now, the collectivism that is happening is a few percent a year.  With the recent recession, it is becoming more open.  We need to be aware of the slow collectivism, and guard against it.  Here is a comparison. </span></p>

Unemployment is the worst in decades, debt levels are off the chart, war is constant and our standing in the world is falling off a cliff.  Many who do have jobs are settling for lower wages and benefits.  Why are countries like China copying our technology and taking control of markets all over the world. Why are our students taking on huge debt loads, and can’t find a decent job when they graduate?  People are losing their pensions, our States are losing their wealth, and our neighbors are losing their homes.  Unlike past recessions, we have lost our manufacturing base, are deep in debt, and face a far more competitive environment in the world.  Much of this destruction in national wealth has happened in just the past ten to twenty years.   There are </span>a number of ways the wealth transfer has taken place. - Transfer or wealth out of America through trade imbalances - Transfer well paying jobs to other countries. </p>

	<p class="block_37"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">The United States has given up its role as the producer of the world.  The US trade balance exceeded 700 billion dollars in 2008.  When NAFTA was passed in the 1990’s, the Clinton Administration stated that all the extra exports would generate </span></span><span class="text_3">jobs</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">ix</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">.  Since that time, a great deal of our manufacturing base has gone offshore, and unemployment has soared. This experiment with globalization is a great success for the globalists.

	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">US oil imports are the largest component of the trade deficit.  Until recently, we were energy independent, but now we import 60 percent of our oil.  Every time someone fills up their gas tank, much of that money leaves the community and goes overseas.   Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, we have sent more money to OPEC for crude oil than in all the time from 1900 to 2001.  Any way to make our own fuel will help the economy.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">The USA has lost its edge in manufacturing.  In the 1940’s and 1950’s manufacturing accounted for close to 30 percent of our GDP and was over twice as large as the financial sector.

While we rack up huge debts, we shift jobs overseas and import cheap goods, much of which is made in conditions we find morally bankrupt.  You will notice we had a positive balance in trade into the 1970s’s.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Taxation </p>
	<p class="block_419"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Let’s look at the taxation in America.  Today we accept as a rule that the income tax is the primary means to raise taxes for government services. About 80 percent of tax revenue in 2009 is from your wages.   Twenty percent comes from all other sources - corporate income, excise taxes on fuel, alcohol, cigarettes, and customs duties on imports.  If you go onto the Census Bureau or Whitehouse websites and download data regarding taxes, you find the data goes back only to about 1934 when the Social Security system started.   The total tax receipts go back to 1792, but the details by source go back to 1934.  To go further back, you will need to download old Statistical Abstracts from the Census site, and then look up the numbers in the PDF file.  In the early days, most taxes were collected in tariffs and excise taxes.  The tariffs were a good revenue generator and protected the American worker from cheap products that were being produced in India.  It worked very well to protect jobs, build </span></span><span class="text_3">manufacturing<span class="calibre2"> and help everyone have a decent livable wage.  Later there were </span></span><span class="text_3">a number of<span class="calibre2"> tariffs tied to alcohol, tobacco, and other items.  In 1916 about the same time as the passing of the Federal Reserve, we see the income tax come.

	<p class="block_8">Lets<span class="calibre1"> put this into perspective.  After World War One, Germany had to pay reparations.  They were worn out from the War, the blockade, and flu pandemic.  They signed the treaty which compelled them to pay an enormous amount of money - 31.4 billion dollars, payable in gold.     This led to severe depression, monetary </span>collapse<span class="calibre1"> and the rise of Hitler.  </span>Taking into account<span class="calibre1"> the population (about 60 million) and the change in value of gold (1200 dollars in 2010), this amounts to less than 30,000 dollars per person in 2010 money.  So, the debt load they had to pay which led to great misery, was far less than the amount that every American man, </span>woman<span class="calibre1"> and child has to pay to cover the U.S. national debt.

This is a scam and is a wealth transfer mechanism.   In 2001, the accumulated interest paid was more than the national debt.  Now it is almost as much.  We are just rolling over the interest year after year.  The national debt is not because of greediness on the part of the population.

Derivatives are very high profit margin ventures with no real cost for materials or labor.   If the derivative traders had taken the loss, their revenues would be 172 billion. With the taxpayer bailout, the figure is over 200 billion, and perhaps far more, when you consider all the low interest loans from the Federal Reserve.  </span></p>

Will this trend reverse, level off, continue rising or speed into hyperinflation?  Here is a summary of the national loss of wealth.  All of this was done through legal mechanisms, printing money from thin air and charging interest on that money.  </span></p>
