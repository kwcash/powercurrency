	<p class="block_10">The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere. … Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day and a couple of thousand on the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no. That’s what I call fear fearmongering, unjustified, proven wrong. We’ve got a week, we’ve got two weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write, to pass a bad bill: keep the panic pressure on.</p>

	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Senator James Inhofe stated that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was behind the threats of a great depression.  Paulson, former Chairman of Goldman Sachs pulled a bait and switch and transferred the money to the large banks.  The bailout bill transferred bad debts to the taxpayers while letting the wealthiest banks print money.  Since then, the bailout money has gone in secret to some of the largest shareholders of the Federal Reserve Bank. </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Most Congressmen do not understand the nature of the debt system.  They truly believe there is only one option for money – it must be borrowed into circulation.  They do not understand what Lincoln did or how things were done prior to 1913.  The Democrats and Republicans may switch power every few years, but </span>the end result is the same. More spending, more taxes, more regulation for the public and a deterioration of the nation’s fiscal health. Republicans and Democrats are no different than a single party with two similar factions. We might as well call them the Repocrats. The party platform of the Repocrats:</p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_364"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre24">Tax and Spend, Spend and Tax</span></div>
	<div class="block_364"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre24">Foreign wars at our expense</span></div>
	<div class="block_364"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre24">More regulation</span></div>
	<div class="block_364"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre24">More debt</span></div>
	<div class="block_364"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre24">More power to the Federal Government</span></div>
	<div class="block_365"><span class="bullet_1">- </span><span class="calibre23">More encroachment on the liberties of people. </span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_7">Repocrats – Republicans and Democrats</p>
	<p class="block_105">Repocrats – Repugnant Autocrats</p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1"> The talk radio shows like to argue whether it was Republicans or Democrats, Main Street or Wall Street.  All the arguments over abortion, gay rights, and such are a diversion from the privately printed fiat money system that is out of control and serving a few masters.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">This was not always the case.  Ohio Senator, Warren G. Harding, who was elected to the Presidency in 1920, said in a Congressional inquiry, that the Federal Reserve is a private banking monopoly.  He said: "The Federal Reserve Bank is an institution owned by the stockholding member banks. The Government has not a dollar's worth of stock in it." His term was cut short in 1923, when he died.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Woodrow Wilson said:</p>
	<p class="block_79">"The growth of the nation ... and all our activities are in the hands of a few men ... We have come to be one of the worst ruled; one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world ... no longer a government of free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the free vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">To give some simple illustration of the relationship, let’s look at the Government request to audit financial information.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_366"><span class="calibre1">Congress says to the Federal Reserve.  “We want to audit your books to check to see if your information is accurate”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Federal Reserve says to Congress.  “No”</span></p>
	<p class="block_367">Consequences to the Federal Reserve – Trillions in new wealth transferred to their shareholders, huge bonuses for the staff of their shareholding banks </p>
	<p class="block_368"><span class="calibre1">IRS says to You, a US citizen.  “We want to audit your books to check to see if your information is accurate”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">You  say</span><span class="calibre2"> to the IRS.  “No”</span></p>
	<p class="block_369">Consequences to You – jail time, loss of home, wage garnishment, bad credit, loss of access to future opportunities, debt<span class="calibre1"> and felony conviction on your records.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Congress can fix this corrupt and evil situation.  The final section of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, Sec. 31, </span><span class="calibre1">says  The</span><span class="calibre1"> right to amend, alter, or repeal this Act is hereby expressly reserved.  Congress can abolish the FED or use it for useful purposes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Many Congressmen and Presidents have seen the fraud in the system. Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency from 1920-21, accused the Federal Reserve of deliberately causing the Great Depression. In several speeches made shortly after he lost the chairmanship of the Committee, McFadden investigated the Federal Reserve and found it was run by Wall Street banks and their affiliated European banking houses.  McFadden said: </span></p>
	<p class="block_157">Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Board, which is a Government board, has cheated the Government of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt. The twelve credit monopolies that were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us for our hospitality by undermining our American institutions… </p>
	<p class="block_8">There is a way that the Repocrats have transferred the money making<span class="calibre1"> authority of Congress over to the Wankers.   We will see later that the entire national debt was made from thin air, though the interest on that debt needs to be paid from income taxes.  There is a mechanism that the shareholders of the privately owned Federal Reserve are able to make money out of nothing, and then charge interest to the </span>taxpayers?<span class="calibre1">  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Whenever the Congress is short of money it turns to the Federal Reserve and use the following steps whereby government debt is funded.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">"Step 1. Pass a higher debt limit so that they can borrow more money. Congress can issue interest free Government bonds, or issue more money, but they will borrow instead.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_32">Step 2. Write up an interest bearing<span class="calibre1"> bond for the money it needs.  Sell it to the Federal Reserve</span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Step 3. The Federal Reserve will buy it and charge interest on it.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">Step 4. The US Treasury writes checks against this money.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107">Step 5. The recipients of the checks will spend the money and most of it will land in a bank. </p>
	<p class="block_370"><img src="images/image-4.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre25"/></p>
	<p class="block_105">5.1 Debt and money creation process</p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">Step 6. New bank sends this money back to the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve receives it and increases the reserve account by that amount.  Now the reserve requirement is about ten percent.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Step 7. The bank can lend out 90 percent of that, but the ultimate effect is the banking system can increase the amount in circulation by about ten times.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Note that all this new money is made from nothing, but the banks get to charge interest on it.  This would make Satan envious.  With this mechanism in </span>place<span class="calibre1"> it is easier to see how and why the housing bubble was pushed so hard to expand.  The money is invented from nothing, and when the bubble pops, the bank can come in and take the home, </span>land<span class="calibre1"> and property of the borrowers.  If the large banks can cooperate to make the thin-air money, then when the housing bubble pops, they can write down the money but still get to push people for full payment on loans.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_371"><span class="calibre2">In step seven above, the multiplication effect done through fractional reserve banking allows the banks to create trillions of new dollars from thin air.  </span>So<span class="calibre2"> every dollar created through government borrowing, becomes ten dollars in the economy.  The key is that the banks work together to make this happen and the top banks do work to manipulate the system.  Congress can simply issue the money debt free to build infrastructure projects.  As the projects complete, then the money can be retired.  Here is a comparison.  </span></p>
