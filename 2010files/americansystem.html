	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The American System was a plan to strengthen and unify the nation.  The interstate highway system was the last great project built under this type of system.  An integrated high speed rail system could be next.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The American System was an economic plan based on the “American School” ideas of Alexander Hamilton.  It consisted of a high tariff to support internal improvements such as </span>road-building, and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise with a national currency. This program was intended to allow the United States to grow and prosper, by providing a defense against the dumping of cheap foreign products from the British Empire.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><span class="calibre1">The American System was the dominant economic system in 19th Century USA.   It strengthened the country, protected </span>innovation<span class="calibre1"> and allowed a strong middle class to develop.  It built out our country to be the leading power in the world by 1920.  This system is now strongly rejected by the powers in charge of our money system.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"> The elements of the American System included:</p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_331"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Support for a high tariff to protect American industries and generate revenue for the federal government</span></div>
	<div class="block_332"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24">Maintenance of high public land prices to generate federal revenue</span></div>
	<div class="block_329"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Preservation of the Bank of the United States to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks</span></div>
	<div class="block_674"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23"><span class="calibre1">Infrastructure such as roads, canals, dams that would tie the country together and be financed by land sales and tariffs.  </span></span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">An example of this system was the transcontinental railway which started to be built during the Civil War.  The Pacific Railway Act was passed on July 1, 1862.  It provided Federal subsidies in land and loans for the construction of a transcontinental railroad across the United States. Congress set aside huge amounts of land for this.    </span><span class="calibre1">The United States understood that rail was a lot more than about delivery of people and goods.  It opened new areas of the country for settlement, and farming. The rail system was a huge accomplishment for the leaders who advocated the American System.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Lincoln pushed the railway system though and was racing to get back to a commodity backed money system.  His plans were to get </span>off of<span class="calibre1"> the emergency debt system and back to a gold and silver standard.  He saw the opening of the West as the salvation of the country.   Shortly before he died Lincoln had a conversation the Speaker of the House, Schuyler Colfax.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_675"><span class="calibre1">Mr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you visit.  I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation.  I believe it practically inexhaustible.  It abounds all over the Western country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has scarcely commenced.  During the war, when we were adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals.  We had the country to save first.  But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we know </span>pretty nearly<span class="calibre1"> the amount of our national debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier.  “Now,” said he, speaking with more emphasis, “I am going to encourage that in every possible way.  We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply of labor than there will be demand for.  I am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough for all. Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe.  I intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the West.  Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability; because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation; </span>and,” said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, “we shall prove, in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the world.”</p>
	<p class="block_676"><span class="text_3">Schuyler was the Speaker of the House when Lincoln was assassinated and was to become the Vice President under Ulysses Grant</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">xii</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Punahoe High School in Hawaii can boast having had two Presidents - President Barack Obama, and President of China Sun Yatsen.   Today in China, Sun is revered.  His portrait is prominently displayed during the 60th birthday celebrations.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Sun Yatsen had great respect for President Lincoln.  He was inspired by Abraham Lincoln and said:</span></p>
	<p class="block_157"><span class="calibre1">“A government of the people, elected by the people and for the people.” These principles have served as the maximum of achievement for Europeans as well as Americans.  Words which have the same sense can be found in China: I have translated them: “nationalism, democracy and socialism.” Of course, there can be other interpretations. The wealth and power of the United States are a striking example of the results of great men’s teachings in that country. I am glad to observe that my principles, too, are shared by the greatest political minds abroad and are not in contradiction to all the world’s democratic schools of thought.” http://www.milestonedocuments.com/documents/full-text/sun-yatsensthe-three-principles-of-the-people</span></p>
	<p class="block_79">In particular he<span class="calibre1"> looked at how the USA developed their intercontinental railroads.  After establishing the Republic Sun focused on strategic </span>plans for the future<span class="calibre1">.   In 1921 Sun Yatsen wrote a strategic plan for the development of China, ‘The International Development of China’.  He invited countries to invest and build out China’s ports, railroads, </span>highways<span class="calibre1"> and manufacturing capabilities.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">He planned a rail network that would link China’s princes and tie in with Central Asia, Russia, and India.  He invited the United States to help China to develop into a </span><span class="calibre1">strong trade partner.  This would create a huge market for their </span>goods, and<span class="calibre1"> open up production that would help the world.  This comprehensive plan was interrupted by war and </span>famine, and<span class="calibre1"> had to wait a few decades.  The plan is going full steam ahead now.      </span></p>
	<h1 id="id_Toc120702758" class="block_4">China adopts the American System.<span class="calibre2">  </span></h1>
	<p class="block_28"> </p>
	<p class="block_677">There are many stories in the business press about China copying American technology and products, movies, ideas, etc..<span class="calibre1">   The biggest thing that China copied from American was the successful American System. Today the United States abandoned the American System, and China uses the American System.  Of course, the Communist leaders will say they use Marxist theory, Lenin concepts, Mao thought, Deng theory and all that lovely stuff.   Today, China uses the same concepts as the American System:  </span></p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_331"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23"><span class="calibre1">Support for a high tariff to protect Chinese industries and generate revenue for the national government.  </span></span></div>
	<div class="block_632"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre24"><span class="calibre2">Maintenance of high public land prices to generate tax revenue.  </span></span></div>
	<div class="block_329"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Preservation of the People’s Bank of China to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks</span></div>
	<div class="block_674"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23"><span class="calibre1">Infrastructure such as train networks, ports, roads, power grids, dams that would tie the country together and be financed by land sales and tariffs.  </span></span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_8">China is building a world class high speed<span class="calibre1"> network.  </span>The overall plan<span class="calibre1"> is to have a vast network that will connect all provincial capitals, and most of the top 250 cities.  Already they have linked Beijing with Tianjin with a non-stop </span>30 minute<span class="calibre1"> ride.  The trains run </span>full, and<span class="calibre1"> have done a lot more than deliver people between the two cities.  It has also spurred a real estate boom that is helping to pay for the railway.  Large tracts of land have been sold to pay for much of the project, while other concessions have been sold.  Property values have more than doubled in the last five years stimulating the economy.  Distribution between the cities is no longer impeded by </span>old overused<span class="calibre1"> highways.  New businesses are popping up. More than 2 </span>Trillion<span class="calibre1"> RMB (about 300 billion USD) has been allocated for the project.  All this money is issued debt free.  The money is issued against the project itself, and as the project will add so much production to the economy, it is </span>self funding<span class="calibre1"> and non-inflationary.  The potential for </span>high speed<span class="calibre1"> transport and distribution will multiply their GDP and pay off the rail system many times over.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_110"><span class="calibre2">One key element of the American System is a Central Bank that issues non-debt national currency.  China was on a </span>debt based<span class="calibre2"> fiat money system in the 1920’s through the 1940’s.  Eventually, the money inflated and collapsed.  The money increased exponentially and was issued by a privately controlled Central Bank.   Now, China issues its own money debt free, and has no national debt.     Money Supply in China is driven by production.  Just as mining for gold and silver in the good old days, China drives their money supply through bring metals, energy, and building materials out of the ground.  Below you can see that the supply of money has risen 12 percent per year for M0 and a much higher rate for M1 and M2.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">China also aims to be energy independent. China takes the energy situation as a national strategic issue to be fixed and is using its large State Own enterprises and Military to fix it.  They are building huge wind farms in China.  They are developing solutions in hybrid vehicles, and battery technology. They are copying some of the R&amp;D that the USA has done with hybrid electric vehicles.   China will adopt the electric and PHEV car. They are not beholden to big oil and even their big energy companies are not locked into oil.</span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">The adoption rate of new things goes very fast.  If production in China takes off for solar and wind like it did for cell phones and computer components, then the energy game will change.   China is world class at mass manufacturing.   They build, </span>build<span class="calibre1"> and build then the people buy. Here is the growth chart for wind energy in China.
