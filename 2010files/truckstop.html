<h1 id="id_Toc120702745" class="block_4">Truck stop</h1>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">We donâ€™t need to mention the burden 4 or 5 dollar per gallon diesel places on truckers in the USA.  The effects multiply throughout the economy.  For the small trucker, this energy inflation could put them out of business for good. </span></p>
	<p class="block_10">Imagine a system in the future that requires little to no diesel, helps solve the energy crisis, prevents electric grid blackouts<span class="calibre1"> and brings new sources of wealth to truckers and the trucking industry.  Truckers not only have cheap </span>energy, and<span class="calibre1"> sell that energy anyone willing to buy it.  We have a system where each truck is a mini power plant, and a large truck stop with truckers can have more energy capacity than a coal power plant...  </span></p>
	<p class="block_531"><img src="images/image-16.png" alt="Image" class="calibre38"/>Of course<span class="calibre1"> you know the automakers are developing hybrid electric cars, and some of these cars plug in to fill up with energy from the electric grid. There is a perception that only small cars are suitable for this plug-in capability.  Is this possible for 18 wheelers?  </span>Yes<span class="calibre1"> and we look no further than prototypes the US Army and Marines are doing with hybrid trucks and tanks.  </span></p>
