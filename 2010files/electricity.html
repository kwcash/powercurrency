 <h1 id="id_Toc120702736" class="block_4">ELECTRICITY</h1>
	<p class="block_217"><span class="calibre1">Electricity reaches into nearly every home and business in the country. This huge grid was developed in the 1930’s and still serves us today.  The high voltage lines are as high as 765,000 volts and then stepped down to 120 volts by the time it reaches the homes.  Massive arteries, trunk lines carry very high voltage electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles to the substations which then step it down.  The voltage is then transformed downward to between 12,000 and 35,000 Volts. Just before it enters your house, it is again transformed further down to 120-240 volts.</span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The power companies spend billions each year to manage the load patterns. The delivery of electricity is near instantaneous.  Power plants use software to predict the demand patterns for their customers.  You can imagine in your own life that you use electricity at a certain pattern.  At home you probably use it early in the morning, and then at night.  During the weekends it would be throughout the day.  Certain major events like major TV shows or sporting events will see a spike in use.  Commercial use ramps during the midday.  The utilities pull all these patterns together to predict a profile across all customers.   </span></p>

	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">There are three times of loads – base, intermediate, and peak.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_219"><span class="calibre1">Base load plants are coal and nuclear power plants and can operate up to 90 percent of the time.  They are very low cost per KWH and are always present.  However, at night, they need to shut down some generators, as people are sleeping.  These factories are efficient but expensive to build.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Intermediate loads use natural gas and operate 25 to 40 percent of the time. This puts out a lot of power and can ramp up very fast.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_220"><span class="calibre2">Peak load is the cheapest to build and the most expensive to run as they use expensive fuels. These will operate one to ten percent of the time.  The cost per KWH can exceed one dollar per KWH.  </span></p>
