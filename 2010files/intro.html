<h1 id="id_Toc120702730" class="block_4">INTRODUCTION</h1>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">The town went through an economic depression.  The local manufacturing plant shut down.  Money was leaving the community.   Unemployment was over 10 percent and the jobs remaining were low paying.  Most people in the town with mortgages owed more than the home was worth. </span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">Foreclosures were at a record high.   The schools and the city budgets were deep in the red.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">In this environment, the town adopted alternative currencies.  These currencies were backed by land, </span>labor<span class="calibre1"> and energy.  The town issued loans against future production to help entrepreneurs get a start.  The people and town set up local energy systems and used electricity credits as money. People laid off from the factory found new jobs or set up workshops making small energy systems.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">People agreed to payment part in Federal Reserve dollars, and part in local currency backed by electricity production.   As the local currency was accepted by many merchants for goods, and the county for some taxes, it circulated well.  Many businesses earned more electric currency credits than they could use.  With this, they went and consumed in the local economy.  The grocer accepted the </span>credits, and<span class="calibre1"> used them to pay the bills for his store and power for his shop.  Soon, he had an excess of electricity credits and used these to pay his own employees as part of their wages and benefits.  He used some to pay his own suppliers who in turn used the credits toward their own delivery vehicles.  The local car dealer saw an excellent opportunity and established a new business converting old cars to hybrid electric vehicles.  He took payment in paper money as well as electric currency.  Soon he built his own wind generators, and then bundled electricity credits with the car sales.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_11"><span class="calibre1">Entrepreneurs built biomass plants which process community waste to make fuel.   This stored energy feeds into the local electricity grid during peak hours.  As time went on, they were able to build a large production base of electricity generation and even augment the pensions with electricity currency.  They funded social programs for schools and elderly with the new money.  In short, the town became self-sufficient and prospered.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre2">They reclaimed their wealth and freedom.  </span></p>
