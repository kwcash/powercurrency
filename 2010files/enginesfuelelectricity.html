	<p class="block_167">Electric power transformed our lives. To a large extent, electricity defines modern technological civilization. The reasons may not be easy to appreciate for those who have never known the filth, toil, and danger associated with obtaining and using such fuels as wood, coal, and whale oil. </p>

	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Now, electricity is clean, flexible, controllable, safe, effortless, and instantly available. In homes, it runs everything from toothbrushes and televisions to heating and cooling systems. Outdoors, electricity guides traffic, aircraft, and ships, and lights up the night. Electricity is an essential part of our life.  Just look at the problems we suffer during ice storms and blackouts. Lack of heating and air conditioning can cause death during extreme weather.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_147"><span class="calibre1">This link with prosperity is well recognized in Asia.  China will add 500 gigawatts of electricity capacity between 2011 and 2016 and it will put China far ahead of any country in the world.   The USA was on such a growth curve, but recent growth has slowed to a trickle.  Instead of doubling every ten years, it was doubling every 35 years and now not even growing.  The USA took all the way to 2005 to reach 1000 gigawatts, and we add about 30 or 40 gigawatts each year.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">We see a strong relationship between growth in GDP and supply of electricity.  </span></p>
