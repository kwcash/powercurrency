	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">US oil imports are the largest component of the trade deficit.  Until about 1965, we were energy independent, but now we import 60 percent of our oil.  Every time someone fills up their gas tank, much of that money leaves the community and goes overseas.   Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, we have sent more money to OPEC for crude oil than in all the time from 1900 to 2001.    </span></p>

	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">You can see in Figure 3.5 that the price of oil also tends to rise, the more that we import.     Every time there is trouble in faraway lands, oil supplies are disrupted, and our fuel prices see a jump.  A pipeline in Nigeria blows up, our gas price goes up.  Trouble with Iran?  Prices go up.  Instability in Iraq?  Prices up.  Russia decides to cut off some gas to </span>Europe?<span class="calibre1">  Prices up. Locally, we have an oil spill in the Gulf of </span><span class="calibre1">Mexico?  Prices up.   All these events give the speculators more opportunities to change the prices up and down.  The </span>long term<span class="calibre1"> trend for oil prices is up, mainly due to money printing.  This is a lot of wealth leaving the country.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">You can see in Table 3.1 that the amount of oil we import has grown dramatically since 1970.   </span></p>

	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">This trend will get worse if we stay addicted to oil.  OPEC has by far the highest level of oil reserves in the world.  This gives them control over our prosperity and points to a future where money continues to leave our communities.    </span></p>

	<p class="block_203"><span class="calibre1">We don’t need to convert our vehicles to electric to get away from imported oil.  In 1906, farmers worked to cash in on the huge market for fuel by making denatured alcohol for automobile fuel.  By using farm </span>wastes<span class="calibre1"> they saved money on disposal and had a new cash crop.  They formed cooperatives for this purpose with the goal to have community distilleries. </span></p>
	<p class="block_204"><span class="calibre1">In 1906 Congress passed laws that supported this movement, but had some trickery hidden in the laws.  Farmers were required to have inspectors </span>year round<span class="calibre1"> and to produce a minimum amount each day.  Farming is seasonal so these requirements were nearly impossible to fulfill.  Prohibition killed what was left of the movement.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_205">Bio-fuels<span class="calibre2"> are ideal as fuels to support Power Currency.  They come from the energy of the sun, so they are renewed always.  They have the potential to replace crude oil and help with the trade deficit.  </span>Bio-diesel<span class="calibre2"> can replace diesel 100 percent while ethanol can replace up to 85 percent of gasoline. Biofuels give better engine performance and less pollution.  Oil and coal have sulfur, while biofuels have none.   They have less CO2 emissions which should appeal to a lot of people.  Some biofuels are made from garbage, sewage, and other wastes.    Along with this, biofuel plants can be </span>small in size<span class="calibre2"> so that farms, towns and cities can set up their own production.  This keeps the money in the community and adds to local wealth.  </span></p>
