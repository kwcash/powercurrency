	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Congress has the power to take over the Federal Reserve and to issue debt free money.  It can issue this money against the credit of the United States and does not need to hand this awesome power over to some small group of banks.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_215">Western Lands Energy Homesteads</p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Much of the American West was founded by settlers who claimed land and set up homesteads.  The Homestead Acts of 1862, 1909 and 1916 gave settlers an opportunity to gain title to federal land.  The law required people to improve the land and after five years file for the deed. Eventually 1.6 million homesteads were </span>granted<span class="calibre1"> and 420 thousand square miles of federal land were privatized between 1862 and 1934.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">We can do the same now with energy.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a 100 mile by 100 mile plot of land in the Southwest USA, fitted with solar energy systems, could provide enough electricity for the entire United States. Looking at the 100 mile<span class="calibre1"> by 100 mile plot of land gives us 6.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million surface acres of US land.  Just a small part of this is enough space to build enough energy projects to increase our energy wealth many times over.  This would kill the dependence on oil imports, support transportation projects and support millions of new </span>full time<span class="calibre1"> jobs.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19">Now, the BLM supports all sorts of oil, gas<span class="calibre1"> and coal production. Over five billion dollars is collected each year from royalties – half goes to the State, and half to the Federal Government - reducing the need for income taxes. The BLM is spending $41 million for 65 projects to test production of renewable energy on their lands.  These lands are ideal for tapping into wind, solar, geothermal and biomass potential.  Alternative liquid fuels are also made from waste products or switch grass.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_441"><span class="calibre1">Looking at the map you can see that the lands are in the Western USA with a great deal of that in the sunny Southwest desert.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Here we set up a system for energy homesteads.  Let’s use a solar project as a benchmark.  In 2006, </span>Acciona<span class="calibre1"> Energy built a Concentrated Solar thermal project in the Nevada desert 40 miles from Las Vegas.  This uses parabolic troughs and </span>started<span class="calibre1"> operation in 2007.     </span></p>

	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">Annual Operation and Maintenance Jobs:  30</span></p>
	<p class="block_105">Based on this, we generate the following numbers</p>
	<p class="block_154">4,156 dollars per KWH cap cost</p>
	<p class="block_154">2,093 KWH per year per KWH installed capacity</p>

	<p class="block_696">We allow for storage, roads, transmission<span class="calibre1"> and other land.   Let’s say that one square mile, or 640 acres, for a 64 MWH plant.   400 acres are for the power, and 240 for access roads, </span>storage<span class="calibre1"> and extra support.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">We can project that the unit cost will drop as we do mass production.  After 50 plants are built, we can get the cost down to 2000 dollars per KWH, and after 250 plants we can get the cost down to 1000 dollars per KWH.   We allocate 10 percent of the energy output to pay for ongoing operations and dividends for the investors.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_697">Right now<span class="calibre2"> the BLM leases 45 million acres for drilling and mining.  Of this 45 million, 11.7 are managed and only 472,000 acres are directly disturbed by oil and gas activity.  Solar and wind each have 20 million acres of potential within the BLM </span>lands so we do not have a land problem. </p>

	<p class="block_705"><span class="calibre1">The first scenario matches the amount of land that is disturbed by coal mining, and oil &amp; gas drilling.  This one would increase our energy supply 2.5 percent while adding over a quarter million jobs.  Think how much imported oil we could displace, and the amount of money that gets circulated within the community.  The second scenario would use only ten percent of the BLM land that is suitable for solar energy.  This would give us enough renewable energy for all cars to go electric.  If you are into the global warming propaganda, it would displace scores of coal plants and save a kajillion tons of CO2.  It would increase the total USA energy output over ten percent, while providing over one million jobs.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_706">Offshore Wind Energy Homesteads</p>
	<p class="block_79">Along the Atlantic seaboard there are a number of<span class="calibre1"> offshore wind farms in the planning stage.  These all seem to be stuck in bureaucratic red tape.  Offshore wind is a proven technology in Europe. Already five countries have built more than 100 MWH or offshore wind capacity.</span></p>
	<p class="block_154"> United Kingdom more than 1300 MWH</p>
	<p class="block_154"> Denmark more than 800 MWH</p>
	<p class="block_154"> Netherlands more than 200 MWH</p>
	<p class="block_154"> Belgium more than 150 MWH</p>
	<p class="block_154"> Sweden more than 100 MWH</p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">There are thousands of MWH being constructed now and tens of thousands of MWH being planned.  These projects cost more to </span>build, but<span class="calibre1"> are far less complex than offshore drilling rigs.  Technically there is not a problem. There are a lot of advantages to offshore wind.  It is pretty much out of sight.  The wind is steadier, so you get more energy.  Undersea power transmission cables can get up to the large coastal cities, taking pressure off the need to build new ugly above ground transmission towers.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79">Right now<span class="calibre1"> the projects are all being financed with debt backed money, so ultimately a lot of the money will go back to the shareholders of the Federal Reserve.  Instead of that, the Government can issue the money debt free and charge zero to two percent financing.  Any interest into the Treasury can be used for general revenue and to offset income taxes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_307"><span class="calibre2">Let’s set up a scenario here.  We plan to build 1000 MWH capacity of wind farms.  Each MWH will average out to 5000 dollars, so the project costs five billion dollars.  The US Government issues five billion in debt free money.  They charge one percent interest on this money, and that money goes back to the Treasury to cover some other expenses, like healthcare for the contractors, admin, insider dealings and so forth.  Let’s look at it here comparing US backed non-debt money to Federal Reserve Bank debt money.  </span></p>

	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">This is four cents purely from paying interest to the bankers at five percent as opposed to paying one percent interest for government backed debt. Remember, this money lent by the Wankers is made from thin air.   </span>This four cents<span class="calibre1"> extra on each KWH would work its way through the economy. The baker, retailer, and producer all need to pass on this extra four cents (or about 30 percent) onto the next person.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">Now, if you have a choice, what would you choose?  </span></p>
	<p class="block_428">The government could issue the money, and<span class="calibre1"> let one big utility do all the work and then set a certain fee for all output.   This is the way we accept as normal in 2010.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Or there is the third way.   This is an ideal project to use for US issued debt free money converted into Power Currency.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">The financing for this is carried out among people who choose to participate.   As people buy new electric or hybrid electric cars, they have the option to buy a slice of production of the project.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_154">New car owners - 200 thousand owners finance 2 billion </p>
	<p class="block_154">Car conversions - 50 thousand finance 500 million</p>
	<p class="block_721"><span class="calibre1">New homes - 100 thousand finance 600 million Distressed homes - 100 thousand finance 600 million Government, Investors, Other finance 1.3 billion.  Total is 5 billion.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_722"><span class="calibre1">Here is a breakdown for a new car sale.  Someone buys a new electric or hybrid car.  That car needs 400 watts per mile.  They buy a package that gives them 15000 miles over the next forty years, which is the expected life of the wind turbine.  This is financed for the first twenty years and the second twenty years is all theirs to keep.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_155"><span class="calibre1">15000 miles X 400 watts per mile is 6000 KWH need each year, or 500 each month.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_154">6000 KWH needs 2 KWH capacity</p>
	<p class="block_255"><span class="calibre1">Each KWH of capacity costs 5000 dollars, so they will need a loan for 10,000 dollars.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_255">Using a 20 year<span class="calibre1"> loan at one percent interest, we get monthly payments of 46 dollars.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_723">500 KWH each month costing 12 cents is worth 60 dollars<span class="calibre1"> so they have a nice 14 dollar benefit there.  As electricity prices go up in the future, this benefit increases.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8">So<span class="calibre1"> in this deal, the new car owner would have a monthly payment of 46 dollars over the next twenty years, as opposed to 60 dollars.  Any KWH the car owner does not use is used as money in the form of Power Currency. Any time the owner is short of KWH in any month, he can buy from the electric grid.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">This is a better system than taxation.  It would stir the market and provide the financing.  Compare this to the current situation where money is hard to raise and there are all sorts of hands in the cookie jar.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Now the government taxes you, then borrows from the Federal Reserve and adds to the national debt.  Finally, they come back to you to pay the interest on the national debt.  The government says they will issue grants to research and development for developing the turbines and other items. That grant money comes from the budget which must be borrow from the banks, and back to the debt which ultimately is paid by the taxpayer.  At all points, there is debt and taxes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">A better way is to have public works projects that are privately financed. The government can provide a support for the private economy instead of the private economy supporting bureaucrats and usurers.  This can also be done with homeowners.  They use the same calculations we went through with cars.  You replace miles with home energy use and bundle the payment in with the mortgage payment.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_273"><span class="calibre1">Distressed real estate can use this.  Take property where the mortgage is more than the home is worth.  Now most of those properties are on the government's books but with the interest payments still go to the shareholders of the Federal Reserve.  In this case the beneficiaries are Citigroup, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells </span>Fargo and <span class="calibre1">Bank of America. We could convert a lot of debt Federal Reserve money over to US money right away.  In 2009, there was a huge jump in the Assets and Liabilities of the FED (see table 6.17).  This explosion of the financial system came from the bubbles bursting and the crash in 2008.  Assets and liabilities more than doubled in 2008.  This was the financial crisis.  There is a lot of detail here and the Federal Reserve Bank has made strong efforts not to release the details of the transactions.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">The banks were able to shift their bad loans over to the Federal Reserve, and onto the taxpayer.  The Agency and GSE backed securities are companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The bad loans that were on the books of the banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, </span>Citibank<span class="calibre1"> and JP Morgan Chase, were shifted over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Then those bad assets were shifted to the Fed’s balance sheet.  Also, notice in table 6.17 how the Federal Reserve increased the bank reserves of those banks from 20 billion in 2007 to 860 billion in 2008.  It’s great if you can be in this industry and twist arms and get laws passed that transfer 800 billion dollars over to your balance sheet.  The rest of us </span>have to<span class="calibre1"> work for a living.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Using this energy project in conjunction with the distressed property, the government swaps out the mortgage note to a US Government debt free based note that charges one percent interest.  Then they add in some of the energy production on top, and wrap the notes together, to make the overall note healthier.   A homeowner that is upside down on their note can switch over to US Government money through US Government Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  </span></p>
