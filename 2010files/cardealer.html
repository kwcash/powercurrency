	<p class="block_71"><span class="calibre2">There are over 20,000 car dealers in the USA.        </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">A rural Car dealer decides to get into the electric business in a big way.  He sells all types of </span>cars, and<span class="calibre1"> sets up various mechanisms to package energy value with the car.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="calibre1">Later, the Car Manufacturer and Car Dealer Association sets up wind farms financed by a State Bank.  This financing supports thousands of consumer loans that include energy production bundled with the cars. Total cost of ownership for the cars and fuel drops 20 percent. </span></p>
	<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">The local dealer has a refurbishing operation.  Old cars are stripped of transmission, engine, catalytic converter platinum, and sold off to scrap yards.  Some cars get battery packs and small generators and are back on the road.         </span></p>
	<p class="block_253"><span class="calibre1">Car dealer sets up the scheme to sell, finance and wrap financing around car purchases.  This is very lucrative for the car dealer as he can make extra commissions on financing of larger purchases.  He can earn extra ongoing income streams paid in </span><span class="calibre1">power currency.  He then can use this money many ways â€“ incentives, operation, financing.   Later, this develops into fully integrated energy and transportation companies bundling the car and electricity.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">The old way:  Finance the car over five years at six percent.  Owner will pay for gasoline as he uses it. </span></p>
	<p class="block_529"><span class="calibre1">Alternative way.  Finance the car over five years at 6 percent.  He finances part of a wind farm at 2 percent interest.  The electricity from the wind farm is enough for most of his transportation, and some extra for paying Power Currency into the community.  </span></p>
