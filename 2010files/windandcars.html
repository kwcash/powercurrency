<h1 id="id_Toc120702743" class="block_4">Wind and Cars</h1>
	<p class="block_525"><span class="calibre1">Wind is an excellent source of power as it is so cheap now to set up and is approaching the threshold where it will be cheaper than coal.  Let’s say we put up a large wind farm onshore or offshore.  It consists of twenty 2 MWH turbines that produce an average of 150 MWH of electricity per day. </span>However<span class="calibre1"> this energy is somewhat unpredictable as the wind is not constant.  Now let’s combine these with cars.  There will always be some cars plugged into the grid.  These can take the energy during the off-peak times and </span>feed back<span class="calibre1"> during the afternoon peak times.    When the wind is blowing the turbines will be feeding straight into the grid. When the wind is not blowing then the grid can suck some juice from the car batteries. </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">Another great thing about V2G is the ramp up rate or the time it takes to get the electricity onto the grid. Right now, utilities need to keep a large amount of extra capacity on hand.  Vehicle to Grid will replace a lot of capital costs.  Cars can earn extra money by being the spinning reserves. This opens new financing methods. For example, car owners can finance wind farms.   We can have financing schemes offering a car, renewable power capacity, and a guaranteed amount of KWH per week. In an emergency, cars send energy into the grid. Vehicles hook into their local energy grid and provide power to homes, hospitals, etc... Thousands of cars and trucks can feed the grid in these situations and mitigate the effects of a blackout. </span></p>
