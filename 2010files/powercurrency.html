<h1 id="id_Toc120702731" class="block_13">POWER CURRENCY<span class="calibre2">  </span></h1>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_3">Facebook, Groupon, Farmville, Google, Twitter, Paypal<span class="calibre2"> - the hot new economy.  These great enterprises came from an </span></span><span class="text_3">idea, and<span class="calibre2"> spread like wildfire.  There was some venture funding, but for the most part, these internet driven ventures all grew from an entrepreneur’s dream and tapped into the 21</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">st</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> Century rulebook.  These are all great ideas, and a lot of the growth is driven by using some form of new alternative currency – </span></span><span class="text_3">facebook credits, groupons, game cash, adsense<span class="calibre2">, and so forth.  This currency motivates people to </span></span><span class="text_3">enter into<span class="calibre2"> that alternative economy and participate.  The hypergrowth of these companies reflect that.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="calibre1">Right now, electricity is used as an alternative currency in many US States through ‘net metering’ laws.    We can do more.  Using the </span>technology we </p>
	<p class="block_16">i</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_3">have now, we can develop a new money <span class="calibre1">-  money</span></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre1"> that is backed by energy. With this new currency, we can wipe out debt, unemployment, poverty, and oil imports.  Power Currency can lead to increasing the economy 100 times in our </span></span><span class="text_3">lifetime, and get us out of the 20</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"> Century Drill for Oil economy and into the 21</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">st</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre1"> Century Outer Space economy.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_18"><span class="text_3">Right now<span class="calibre2"> we have installed capacity of just over one million MWH of electricity potential.  China is building 500 thousand MWH capacity in just the next five </span></span><span class="text_3">years</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">i</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">.  This is half of the capacity that the USA has built all during the 20</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> Century.   The US Energy Information Agency thinks the USA will have an average growth rate of one percent per year through 2030</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">ii</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">.  This would bring us up to 1.3 million MWH capacity.  This is far too small.  Using some of the strengths of Facebook, </span></span><span class="text_3">Google<span class="calibre2"> and Twitter, we can invent our way out of this economic downturn and increase our energy production ten-fold by 2030.  The energy and money establishments are controlled by powerful interest groups, but this does not matter.  We can make this happen and 95 percent of what we need, is already in our hands now.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">The energy situation in the USA offers the biggest opportunity in the history of the world.  Oil prices are passing records highs and energy is strictly controlled.  Americans are creative and when faced with a tough situation, they invent and work their way out.  Stressful times bring about great innovation.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">Money is a human creation. Anything can be money if people put a value on it and it is accepted as a medium of exchange.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">It is normal for money to change with the times.  Normally, there is a dominant currency (such as Federal Reserve notes in the USA), then there can be all kinds of other types of money.  In the USA, we tend to use only one type of money – the dollar, but there have been all kinds of money through history.   </span></p>

	<p class="block_29">1.1 Types of money in America</p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">How many of these types of money in Table 1.1 do you use?  No doubt you can add a few more to the list.  Not everyone will agree that </span>facebook<span class="calibre1"> credits are a form of money.  However, the people who use </span>facebook credits to transact a deal certainly see it as money and use it as money. </p>
	<p class="block_30"><span class="calibre2">Now, so much of our society is dependent on energy.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">The earliest form of money was straight one to one barter. Salt, copper, bronze, shells, gold, silver, rum, tobacco, grains, animals were all used. Farmers would trade their harvest for animal skins for example.  Barter was not convenient as you needed to find someone to accept what you had to offer.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">As society grew and became more complex, this arrangement was impractical.  One of the innovations was the merchant who opened a general store.  He stocked all the things the town might need.  The farmers, traders, and housewives went there to buy and trade things as needed - cinnamon, sugar, boots, bread, coats, and canes.  </span>Still<span class="calibre1"> they could carry out barter of goods but they had more options regarding the things they could buy.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">From this, the merchant would find there was a certain commodity which had general acceptance in the community.  Tobacco was used as money in Virginia during colonial times.  In other places, you might see corn used as money.  It all evolved from social norms.  People found a certain item that served best for their community.  Throughout history, gold and silver have fit nicely as a medium of exchange.   Gold and silver will always be good as money and there will always be a call to have money that is backed by gold or silver.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_32">We could certainly have electricity and energy backed money, if<span class="calibre1"> people will agree to it.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">New types of money can come because of innovation.  Airline miles are an example of this.  Some tech savvy teens and young adults use the new forms of virtual money.  Facebook was built on top of the virtual money </span>system, and<span class="calibre1"> is monetizing into traditional money later.  In any case, it </span>has to<span class="calibre1"> be accepted by people using the money, as the medium of exchange.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_33"><span class="calibre1">In times of trouble, people will come up with new forms of money out of necessity.  The USA saw thousands of communities use community issued scrip during hard times.   During the Banking Panic of 1907, there was a terrible shortage of money in the USA.     Instead of general collapse, people found ways to use new forms of money.   Clearinghouse currencies in small denomination were marked “payable through the clearinghouse” and the member banks agreed to accept them.   Negotiable cashier’s checks were written in 5, 10, or 20 dollar amounts and were payable to some person or entity, “John Smith” or “bearer” or such.  These were technically illegal but accepted by the population.  Companies paid employees in large numbers of small amounts of scrip.  The scrip was the liability of the company issuing </span>it, and<span class="calibre1"> was passed from hand to hand as a form of money.  Some streetcar companies paid their employees in streetcar tokens and tickets.  These circulated well as they had value as streetcar rides.  In 1907, banks went along with this as it helped to prevent runs on banks.  People used alternative currencies and did not need to withdraw so much money from the bank.  With a severe shortage of money in the city, people figured out how to deal with the situation.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_34"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Alternative currencies will always be accepted and work quite well if the people agree to use them.  Most of these alternative currencies in 1907 were technically illegal.  </span></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Everyone knew they were illegal, but nobody did anything about it.  Part of the reason was the lack of currency, but also, the use was so widespread that the government could not stop it.  To government bureaucrats and collectivists, this was a nightmare.  This competes with establish centrally controlled money.  </span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">iii</sup></span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">We can further classify money into fiat and commodity.  People accept fiat paper money because they are forced to by the King or Government, and they feel confident they can use it later to purchase what they need.  If people lose faith in the money or there is too much paper money, then that money becomes worthless.   We see this during times of trouble such as with the US Confederate States, Weimar Germany, China in the 1940’s, and now in Zimbabwe.   Our Federal Reserve dollars we use now are fiat paper money.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">Commodity money is often called ‘hard money’.  If there was a disaster, and the Federal Reserve dollars we use now have no value, what would you use for money?  When economies break down, people tend to move to money that is commodity backed such as gold, silver, tobacco, tea, corn, jade, rice, etc...   Commodity money itself has intrinsic value.   In some situations, an apple or gallon of water would be worth more than a pound of gold.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">It is worthwhile to go back to Table 1.1 and write in a few notes.  If your State is under financial duress, think of new types of money they can use. </span>As long as<span class="calibre1"> people will accept it, then it can be used as a sort of money.   If there is a collapse in the paper money, what will you use for money?  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">If you listen to the media, you hear that loss of the paper money would lead to loss of money itself.  This is propaganda.  The money will change to something else.   If you are a doctor, dentist, carpenter, or plumber you will be fine.  If you are a lawyer or college professor, you may or may not do so well.  If you are a farmer, and can control your land, then your land and crops will be fine as money.  Sorry to say but people with guns will do better than people without guns.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_35"><span class="calibre1">There is also paper money that is backed by some commodity, which falls in between.  Examples in Table 1.1 are U.S. Dollar Gold and Silver Certificates.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_36"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Previously in Table 1.1 we listed types of money.  Below are the levels of money supply during the 19</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"> to 20</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">th</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> Century.  Today we only think of one kind of money – the Federal Reserve Dollar.  This is not normal.  Prior to 1970, there were a lot of different types of money.  There was hard commodity money, United States </span></span><span class="text_3">Dollars<span class="calibre2"> and Federal Reserve Dollars.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_37"><span class="text_3">This data in Table 1.2 comes from the US Statistical Abstracts which you can find on the Census site</span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">iv</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">.  </span></span></p>

	<p class="block_70">Statistical Abstract and Federal Reserve Bank</p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">You can see that the money supply was somewhat steady until about 1970. In fact, it was very difficult to inflate.  The money was fixed to silver and gold.  We needed to dig it out of the ground so there was a natural limit on currency inflation.  If there was too much silver in the economy, it would find its way overseas in exchange for silk, tea, spices, and other goods. There is no such limit to paper money, especially in the computer age.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">You can also see a clear shift in our money from debt free over to 99 percent debt.  The Federal Reserve Dollars come from money that is loaned into the economy.  Note the enormous growth in the amount of Federal Reserve Dollars in the past few decades.  These new types of Federal Reserve Dollars can simply be printed, and if they run out of paper, they can put the values in the computer or put bigger numbers on the paper bills.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_71">Through our history there was a shift in types of money</p>
	<p class="block_72"><span class="calibre1">1620 to 1913.  Money is primarily commodity backed.  Most of the money that came into circulation was produced in the form of gold and silver.  There were </span><span class="calibre1">other forms of money in colonial times.  Most money is debt free, while debt money is used for mortgages and commerce.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">1913 to 1965.  There is a steady shift from United States dollars to Federal Reserve dollars: debt-free money to </span>debt based<span class="calibre1"> money.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_73"><span class="calibre1">1965 to 2008.  Debt free US dollars are eliminated and close to 100 percent of money is Federal Reserve Dollars backed by US Government debt.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">2008 to today.  Money today is backed by US Government debt, subprime </span>mortgages<span class="calibre1"> and bad commercial debt.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_74"><span class="calibre1">There is a huge inflation in money supply.  In the 1950’s there was still some restraint on the printing of money but by 2008 this restraint has died. Now, most of this money is not printed; it is put into the bank’s computers as digits.  It is too easy for the Federal Reserve to make money now, and this causes fast growth in money inflation and price inflation.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_75"><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2">Besides water, can you think of a commodity used by more people than energy?  Everyone uses electricity.  The Census says there are 111 million homes in America, and 111 million homes use electricity.  If we can find a way to use energy – especially electricity - as a medium of exchange, then we have a money for the 21</span></span><span class="text_4"><sup class="calibre3">st</sup></span><span class="text_3"><span class="calibre2"> Century.  It has the commodity advantages that gold and silver </span></span><span class="text_3">have, and<span class="calibre2"> has the widespread use that paper money has.    In Table 1.2 if we extend to the future, Power Currency would fall into the category of ‘Hard Money’.  </span></span></p>
	<p class="block_76">Of course<span class="calibre1"> the biggest drawback is we cannot really store watt hours, or kilowatt hours.  To fix this, we consider Power Currency to have three components.</span></p>
	<p class="block_76"><b class="calibre6">Machines </b>– steam turbines, nuclear power, PV cells, wind turbine, generator, car engine, ship engines and farm machines.</p>
	<p class="block_76"><b class="calibre6">Fuels </b>– oil, coal, biomass, sunlight (if harnessed), bio-diesel<span class="calibre1">, ethanol, gas, wood, and waste.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_77"><b class="calibre6">Electricity</b> – the making, delivery<span class="calibre1"> and use of electricity.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_78"><span class="calibre1">Electricity us used by everyone but cannot be stored.  Fuel can be </span>stored, and<span class="calibre1"> could be used to back money but is difficult to distribute except through centralized means.  Engines cannot really be used as </span>money<span class="calibre1"> but they are a good alternative to gold and silver as an asset. Working together, engines, fuel and electricity can provide the foundation for a new type of money.  We will go into detail how this works later in the book.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Economic textbooks say that money has three characteristics – medium of exchange, unit of account, and standard of value.   In this chapter we covered medium of exchange - money </span>has to<span class="calibre1"> be accepted and valued by society.   We will cover unit of account and standard of value later in the next chapter.   Electricity is used by </span>everyone<span class="calibre1"> but can we figure a way to make it the basis for money.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">You say, ‘Stop! ‘We can’t do that!  You are messing with THE MAN, the IRS, Uncle Sam, Big Oil, Wall Street! They will never allow it!  I want my money back!’  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">You are right, we need to make sure things are legal.  You see the ‘Liberty Dollar’ in Table 1.1.  The founder of that is in jail.  He went a bit too far and challenged both the money monopoly and the Government.   These proposals assume that the necessary legal steps are done.  Congress can pass laws.  States can issue money under some restrictions.  Some alternative monies can exist if done the proper way.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_80"><span class="calibre1">Now, with modern technology and our energy backed economy, kilowatt hours can be a new widely accepted form of money.   As an alternative money, it could be as legal as </span>facebook<span class="calibre1"> credits or Disney dollars – it is tolerated.  As a </span>Government<span class="calibre1"> backed money, it can have the strength of gold and the acceptance of paper money.   Many States already allow some very limited form of this through ‘Net Metering’ or ‘feed in tariffs’ where electric utilities are required to purchase excess energy from homeowners who have solar energy systems.  It would not take too much to take this to the next level.   It has the potential to change the game and the economy. </span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">I make the case for Power Currency as a national currency that replaces our existing money system.     </span></p>
