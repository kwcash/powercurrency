	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre1">Can you imagine using the old telephone system with copper wires? Most of the country is served by an electric grid build decades ago.      </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">The Internet replaced the old telephone network and we will see more of the same now with distributed energy. Software and telecom enable a lot of the new capabilities. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="calibre1">It is conceivable that we could triple our energy production without needing to add too much in the way of high voltage transmission lines. The utilities may need to upgrade their transformers and such equipment as new power sources come online.   In a modern network, the computers communicate automatically to link with compatible partners.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_10">The power grid has capacity constraints are aging and expensive to improve. Construction of new power plants and transmission capacity is expensive. At times, demand for electricity has caused shortages, brown outs, and occasional large scale<span class="calibre1"> blackouts.  Utilities and software companies build their networks to meet customer demand. The conventional way to handle customer demand is to build more power plants, which requires a large amount of capital and planning. This book proposes that while some large power plants are fine, it is not necessary. The power developed through distributed energy could easily triple the output by 2030 without any </span>new large<span class="calibre1"> power plants.   The smart grid takes the IT tools we </span>use, and<span class="calibre1"> applies it to the antiquated electricity grid.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_9">The demand side programs in place push consumers to change their energy use through efficiency and load management. </p>
	<p class="block_465">The Department of Energy defines the Smart Grid:</p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_466"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Intelligent – capable of sensing system overloads and rerouting power to prevent or minimize a potential outage; of working autonomously when conditions require resolution faster than humans can respond…and cooperatively in aligning the goals of utilities, consumers and regulators</span></div>
	<div class="block_466"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Efficient – capable of meeting increased consumer demand without adding infrastructure</span></div>
	<div class="block_467"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Accommodating – accepting energy from most fuel sources including solar and wind as easily and transparently as coal and natural gas; capable of integrating any and all better ideas and technologies – energy storage technologies, for example – as they are market-proven and ready to come online</span></div>
	<div class="block_468"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Motivating – enabling real-time communication between the consumer and utility so consumers can tailor their energy consumption based on individual preferences, like price and/or environmental concerns</span></div>
	<div class="block_467"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Opportunistic – creating new opportunities and markets by means of its ability to capitalize on plug-and-play innovation wherever and whenever appropriate</span></div>
	<div class="block_467"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Quality-focused – capable of delivering the power quality necessary – free of sags, spikes, disturbances and interruptions – to power our increasingly digital economy and the data centers, computers and electronics necessary to make it run</span></div>
	<div class="block_466"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Resilient – increasingly resistant to attack and natural disasters as it becomes more decentralized and reinforced with Smart Grid security protocols</span></div>
	<div class="block_469"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">“Green” – slowing the advance of global climate change and offering a genuine path toward significant environmental improvement</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_470">DOE lists five fundamental technologies that will drive the Smart Grid:</p>
	<div class="calibre22">
	<div class="block_471"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Integrated communications, connecting components to open architecture for real-time information and control, allowing every part of the grid to both ‘talk’ and ‘listen’</span></div>
	<div class="block_471"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Sensing and measurement technologies, to support faster and more accurate response such as remote monitoring, time-of-use pricing and demand-side management</span></div>
	<div class="block_329"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Advanced components, to apply the latest research in superconductivity, storage, power electronics and diagnostics</span></div>
	<div class="block_471"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Advanced control methods, to monitor essential components, enabling rapid diagnosis and precise solutions appropriate to any event</span></div>
	<div class="block_333"><span class="bullet_1">• </span><span class="calibre23">Improved interfaces and decision support, to amplify human decision-making, transforming grid operators and managers quite literally into visionaries when it come to seeing into their systems</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_10">Many people compare the transformation of the smart grid to the building of the interstate highway system. That is a good analogy if you are a big utility and looking to such up infrastructure spending. </p>
	<p class="block_472"><span class="calibre2">The smart grid has the potential to be good or bad.  Utilities and governments could collect trillions of bits of information and compile dossiers on our personal lives. The potential for abuse is enough the make a Stasi agent in old East Germany jump for joy. What will the companies and government do with the data? If they will not use it to control people, then why collect it in the first place?</span></p>

	<p class="block_10">Think of a business model similar to<span class="calibre1"> the cell phone market. Some big companies put in place the towers, and infrastructure, and the individuals will buy the phones. Can you imagine if you had to buy your cell phone only from an approved vendor and had no choice in the type of phone, price, style, color, and features?
