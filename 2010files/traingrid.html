<h1 id="id_Toc120702761" class="block_4">TRAINGRID</h1>
	<p class="block_8">Another national project we can do along these lines is a national high speed<span class="calibre1"> rail.  Looking at the map of the USA, lets imagine a </span>high speed<span class="calibre1"> rail system driven by electricity and funded by energy homesteads and Social Security taxes.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_31">It is reasonable to build a high speed<span class="calibre1"> railroad linking Los Angeles to the Mississippi River (St Louis).  This line could connect Vegas, Phoenix, Kansas City and have branch lines to Denver, Dallas, etc.  The electricity comes from energy homesteads, independent power producers, coal plants, wind farms and solar thermal energy.  This would create over one million </span>jobs, and<span class="calibre1"> give us a faster transportation sector.  Kansas State fans could take a Thursday overnight train to watch a basketball match with UCLA, have a great weekend, and return for class Monday morning.   The transportation energy costs will be reduced by 50 percent compared to truck transportation, and time is cut in half. </span></p>
	<p class="block_273"><span class="calibre1">The train grid integrates with the transmission lines. This power line will parallel with rail lines and shifts energy back and forth along the route and population centers.  This type of grid would take some engineering and inventions.   We put men on the moon, didn’t we?</span></p>
	<p class="block_10"><span class="calibre1">How to fund?  The Train project is funded with United States Notes (not Federal Reserve Notes) that are backed by land, energy production and transportation.  Large tracts of desert in Nevada and other States become opened to private investment through energy homesteads and big Government funding from social security payroll taxes. This investment is in the form of zero interest loans backed by national debt free currency. Repayment is in the form of power currency and United States issued money.  The United States Dollars could even be backed by energy and train traffic.  Social Security recipients can use this money pay their energy bills, and travel on trains.  The extra money is spent into the economy. Eventually, people will redeem this money.  Contractors and workers are paid in debt free currency which would drop the overall costs dramatically. </span></p>
	<p class="block_105"><span class="calibre1">Let’s take Train Grid and Social Security and see what we can develop.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_10"> “Under current law, the cost of Social Security will soon begin to increase faster than the program’s income because of the aging of the baby-boom generation, expected continuing low fertility (compared to the baby-boom period), and increasing life expectancy. Based on the Trustees’ best estimate, program cost will exceed tax revenues starting in 2016 and throughout the remainder of the 75-year projection period. “</p>
	<p class="block_258">Social Security Annual Report</p>
	<p class="block_726"><span class="calibre1">There are various estimates regarding the future of Social Security - all predict that the system will run out of money.  Some estimates say that the system will be completely bankrupt in 25 years.   The Feds admit that they have spent </span>all of<span class="calibre1"> the Social Security taxes they have collected over the past 70 years, and now they must pay for Social Security out of general tax revenues.  In 2010, they offered no </span>cost of living<span class="calibre1"> increase in benefits to account for inflation, and it is likely we will see this happen more in the future.    </span></p>

	<p class="block_107">In 2008, 900 Billion<span class="calibre1"> in Social Security taxes was collected, and about that much was paid out.  The problem from now on is that more will be paid out than will be received in taxes.

	<p class="block_30">Now the Repocrats and Wankers say we only have two options to fix this.</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_409">Tax More</li>
	<li class="block_733">Reduce Benefits</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_79"><span class="calibre1">Taking this 2008 tax figure of 900 billion dollars out over the next 25 years, we come up with more than 20 trillion dollars in taxes to be collected.  Let’s remind ourselves that this money is earned from labor, rather than invented out of thin air as the shareholders of the Federal Reserve can do.   This is an enormous resource that we can use to fund various projects.  Right now, this FICA tax is converted into Federal Reserve money, and depreciates by design into a fraction of its original value.  With no change, this 20 trillion in effort will be stolen from the population and transferred to the shareholders of the Federal Reserve.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_105">Here is how the theft happens:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_734">People work hard and with their employer pay 15 percent of their income in FICA taxes</li>
	<li class="block_411">These FICA taxes are converted into computerized money that is backed by paper money.</li>
	<li class="block_409">Inflation will depreciate this money.</li>
	<li class="block_735"><span class="calibre1">Eventually, this money is sent to the Wankers by paying interest on the National Debt that was invented from thin air.  The money that was lent to fund the national debt was invented from thin air, and now it is paid back with money that comes from people’s labor.  </span></li>
	<li class="block_736"><span class="calibre1">Through funding shortfalls, the Social Security benefits are cut.  by inflating the currency. </span></li>
	<li class="block_737"><span class="calibre1">The Wankers use this money to buy real assets.  They buy farmland, mineral rights, gold, silver, and eventually will buy all the public lands.  </span></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_107"><span class="calibre1">"I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs." </span></p>
	<p class="block_738">Thomas Jefferson</p>
	<p class="block_31"><span class="calibre1">Instead of following the Repocrats, Wankers, and bureaucrats, we can find a better solution - a third option.  We can honor the promises made to the people who have been paying into the system all their lives.  We can offer a decent standard of living for those who need it.  </span></p>
