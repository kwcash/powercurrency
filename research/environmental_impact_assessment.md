## Potential Environmental Benefits

### Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions
- Current emissions from fossil fuel power plants
- Projected reductions with increased renewable energy use

### Land Use Considerations
- Comparison of land use for fossil fuel vs. renewable energy production
- Potential for dual-use of land (e.g., solar farms with agriculture)

### Water Usage
- Water consumption in traditional power plants vs. renewable energy systems

## Potential Environmental Challenges
- Wildlife impacts of large-scale wind and solar installations
- Lifecycle analysis of renewable energy equipment
