## Power Currency Transaction Protocol

1. Transaction Structure
   - Sender ID
   - Recipient ID
   - Amount (in KWH)
   - Timestamp
   - Transaction type (e.g., direct transfer, energy production, energy consumption)
   - Digital signature

2. Encryption
   - Use of asymmetric encryption for transaction signing
   - AES-256 for data encryption in transit and at rest

3. Network Topology
   - Decentralized peer-to-peer network
   - Mesh network structure for resilience
   - Integration with existing power grid communication systems

4. Consensus Mechanism
   - Proof of Energy Production (PoEP) for transaction validation
   - Node reputation system based on energy production and network contribution

5. Data Format
   - JSON for transaction data
   - Protobuf for efficient binary encoding in network transmission
