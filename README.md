## About Power Currency

Power Currency is a non-profit initiative aimed at researching and promoting energy-based economic systems. Our mission is to explore how abundant, clean energy can drive economic prosperity and sustainable development.

### Key Concepts

- **Power Economy**: A economic model based on dramatic increases in clean energy production and utilization.
- **Peer-to-Peer Electricity**: Decentralized energy exchange systems between producers and consumers.
- **Energy-Backed Currency**: A new paradigm in monetary systems tied to energy production and consumption.

## Project Goals

1. Research and develop models for energy-based economic systems
2. Promote the transition to renewable energy sources
3. Explore the integration of energy systems with financial technologies
4. Educate the public on the potential of energy-driven economies

## Repository Contents

- `/docs`: Detailed documentation on Power Currency concepts
- `/research`: Summaries of relevant research and comparative studies
- `/models`: Economic and technical models for Power Economy scenarios
- `/case-studies`: Hypothetical and real-world applications of Power Currency concepts
- `/specs`: Technical specifications for implementing Power Currency systems

## Key Projections

Our research suggests significant potential for growth in renewable energy capacity:

| Scenario       | Installed Capacity (GW) by 2030 | Growth Rate | Renewable Share |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Power Currency |                          20,000|         10% |             90% |

Compare this to conventional projections:

- EIA: 1,250 GW, 1.1% growth, 25% renewable
- EPRI: 1,250 GW, 1.1% growth, 25% renewable
- Google: 1,200 GW, 1% growth, 40% renewable

## Future Vision

We envision a future where:

- Fossil fuel vehicles are replaced by electric and hybrid alternatives
- Energy production increases tenfold
- Pollution is cut in half
- New forms of energy-based commerce emerge
