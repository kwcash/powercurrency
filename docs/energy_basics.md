## Engines, Fuels, and Electricity in Power Currency

### Engines
- Definition: Machines that convert various forms of energy into usable power
- Examples: Steam turbines, gas turbines, wind turbines, solar panels

### Fuels
- Traditional: Oil, coal, natural gas
- Renewable: Solar, wind, hydro, biomass
- Role in Power Currency: Stored potential energy

### Electricity
- The primary form of energy in the Power Currency system
- Measured in kilowatt-hours (KWH)
- Instantly producible and consumable

## Importance of Distributed Energy Resources

1. Resilience: Reduces vulnerability to large-scale outages
2. Efficiency: Minimizes transmission losses
3. Democratization: Allows individuals and communities to participate in energy production
4. Innovation: Encourages development of new energy technologies
5. Economic benefits: Creates local jobs and stimulates local economies
