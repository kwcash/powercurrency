   - # Power Currency Models

This directory contains various Python models for simulating and analyzing different aspects of the Power Currency system. These models are designed to provide insights into energy production, currency issuance, peer-to-peer energy trading, economic impact, and adoption rates.

## Models Overview

1. **energy_production_model.py**: Calculates total energy production from distributed residential systems.

2. **currency_issuance_model.py**: Determines the amount of Power Currency to issue based on energy production.

3. **peer_to_peer_energy_trading_model.py**: Simulates matching energy producers and consumers in a P2P network.

4. **economic_impact_model.py**: Estimates job creation and economic impact of Power Currency implementation.

5. **adoption_rate_model.py**: Projects the adoption rate of Power Currency over time using a sigmoid function.

## Usage

To use these models, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can run each model individually by executing the respective .py file. For example:

```
python energy_production_model.py
```

Feel free to modify the input parameters in each model to simulate different scenarios or to integrate these models into larger analysis pipelines.

## Dependencies

These models use basic Python libraries such as `math` and `numpy`. Ensure you have these libraries installed:

```
pip install numpy
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these models or suggest improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue in the project repository.



We encourage contributors to provide both the model implementations (in various programming languages or modeling tools) and detailed documentation explaining the assumptions, methodologies, and limitations of each model.

When adding new models or modifying existing ones, please ensure they are well-commented and include sample data or scenarios for testing and validation.
